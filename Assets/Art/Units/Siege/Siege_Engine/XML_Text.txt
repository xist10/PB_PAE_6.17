I did the testing using the Trebuchets scale. (0.40)
The Warlords Siegetower uses 0.20 for the scale.
So keep that in mind when setting the scale. You may like it bigger or smaller than me. I found that 0.30 looks OK.

<fScale>0.30</fScale>

Also, you will want to set ranged attack to "0"

<bActAsRanged>0</bActAsRanged>

Don't forget to make sure damagestates is set to "4", or the damage textures won't work.

<iDamageStates>4</iDamageStates>
