		<English>The Tale of Sinuhe is considered one of the finest works of Ancient Egyptian literature. It is a narrative set in the aftermath of the death of Pharaoh Amenemhat I, founder of the 12th dynasty of Egypt, in the early 20th century BC. It is likely that it was composed only shortly after this date, albeit the earliest extant manuscript is from the reign of Amenemhat III, ca. 1800 BC. There is an ongoing debate among Egyptologists as to whether or not the tale is based on actual events involving an individual named Sinuhe, with the consensus being that it is most likely a work of fiction. Due to the universal nature of the themes explored in Sinuhe, including divine providence and mercy, its anonymous author has been described as the "Egyptian Shakespeare" whose ideas have parallels in biblical texts. Sinuhe is considered to be a work written in verse and it may also have been performed. The great popularity of the work is witnessed by the numerous surviving fragments.</English>

		<German>Die Geschichte von Sinuhe ist ein im Original titelloses Werk der alt&#228;gyptischen Literatur aus dem Anfang der 12. Dynastie des Mittleren Reichs (ca. 1900 v. Chr.). Der unbekannte Autor der Dichtung schildert in Form einer Ich-Erz&#228;hlung die vermutlich fiktive Lebensgeschichte des Hofbeamten Sinuhe, der nach dem Tod des K&#246;nigs (Pharao) Amenemhet I. in Panik ger&#228;t und nach einer abenteuerlichen Flucht schlie&#223;lich in der Region Pal&#228;stina sesshaft wird. Doch im Alter wird er von Heimweh geplagt. Tats&#228;chlich bittet ihn Sesostris I. wieder heimzukehren, da er dessen Unschuld am Tode seines Vaters Amenemhet erkannt habe. Daraufhin kehrt Sinuhe nach &#196;gypten zur&#252;ck und wird dort mit allen Ehren empfangen. Die Erz&#228;hlung hat einen starken Bezug zum K&#246;nigshof von Sesostris I. und wird teilweise als eine Art Propaganda angesehen, welche die Loyalit&#228;t zum K&#246;nig betonen soll. Die meisten &#196;gyptologen stimmen darin &#252;berein, dass es sich um ein Meisterwerk der &#228;gyptischen Literatur und die bekannteste Erz&#228;hlung aus dem Alten &#196;gypten handelt.</German>

		<English>[H1]Ariovistus[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Ariovistus was a leader of the Suebi and other allied Germanic peoples in the second quarter of the 1st century BC. He and his followers took part in a war in Gaul, assisting the Arverni and Sequani to defeat their rivals the Aedui, after which they settled in large numbers in conquered Gallic territory in the Alsace region. They were defeated, however, in the Battle of Vosges and driven back over the Rhine in 58 BC by Julius Caesar. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Ariovistus was a native of the Suebi. He spoke Gaulish fluently. [NEWLINE]Ariovistus is described by Caesar as rex Germanorum. This is often translated as "king of the Germans", but as Latin had no definite article it could equally be translated as "king of Germans", with no implication that he ruled all Germans. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Some time before Caesar's governorship of Gaul (which began in 58 BC), the Gaulish Arverni and Sequani enlisted Ariovistus' aid in their war against the Aedui. The Sequani also habitually supported the Germans in their previous frequent expeditions across the river, which shows that Ariovistus' subsequent devastation of Sequani lands represented a new policy. [NEWLINE]The location of the final battle between the Aedui and their enemies, which Caesar names as the Battle of Magetobriga, remains unknown, but Ariovistus' 15,000 men turned the tide, and the Aedui became tributary to the Sequani. Ariovistus seized a third of the Aeduan territory, settling 120,000 Germans there. In order to avoid infringing on his allies for the moment, Ariovistus must have passed over the low divide between the Rhine and the Doubs in the vicinity of Belfort and then have approached the Aedui along the Ognon river valley. That move left the Sequani between him and the Jura mountains, not a tolerable situation for either if they were not going to be allies. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]In 59 BC, while Julius Caesar was consul, Ariovistus had been recognised as "king and friend" by the Roman Senate. He had likely already crossed the Rhine at this point. However, without the status of friend, Ariovistus never could have secured Roman tolerance of his Rhine crossing, whenever it was, but would have been treated as hostile. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]However, the Aedui were also allies of Rome, and in 58 BC Diviciacus, one of their senior magistrates, complained of Ariovistus' cruelty and pleaded with Caesar to intervene on their behalf. Caesar sent ambassadors to summon Ariovistus to a conference. Ariovistus refused the summons, on the grounds that if Caesar wanted to speak to him, he should come to him; besides, he was not prepared to enter Caesar's territory without his army, which it would be impractical and expensive to gather. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Caesar therefore sent his ambassadors back to Ariovistus with his demands: that he bring no more of his people across the Rhine, and that he and his allies restore the hostages they had taken from the Aedui and undertake not to make war against them. He pointed out that Ariovistus was a friend to Rome and that the Romans had a prior interest, which they certainly would enforce. Ariovistus was welcome to keep the friendship of Rome if he would comply. Otherwise he, Caesar, acting in accordance with the decrees of the senate, could not let the harassment of the Aedui go unpunished. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Ariovistus refused to comply, asserting the right of conquest and the right of the conqueror to exact tribute from the conquered. Ridiculing Rome's ability to protect its friends and boasting of Germanic invincibility, Ariovistus invited Caesar to attack him if he wished. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]At the same time that Caesar received Ariovistus' message, he heard from his Celtic allies that the Harudes were devastating the country of the Aedui and that 100 units of Suebi under the brothers Nasua and Cimberius were about to cross the Rhine. In response to these provocative acts, Caesar mobilized his troops. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Caesar was not far away, probably at or near Bibracte, where he had just won a major victory over the Helvetii. Ariovistus, being a skilled general in his own right, identified Vesontio as the key to the strategic Doubs valley and marched for it, but Caesar, probably relying on intelligence from the Gauls, arrived there first and established a main base. He had to combat a panic among his own men, who had heard that the Germans were some sort of superior warriors. Caesar called a meeting and then berated the centurions for making that necessary, instead of just following orders. In one of his noted speeches he recalled them to duty and ended by threatening to march the next morning early with only the 10th legion, about whose valor he said he had no doubts at all. The speech had the intended effect of arousing fanatical loyalty in the 10th and shame and rivalry in the others. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Some, including Ariovistus himself, managed to cross the river in boats or by swimming. Ariovistus may have escaped but it is unlikely that he retained any position in the citizen-army of the Suebi. When the Usipetes and Tencteri were driven from their lands by the Suebi in 55 BC, he is not mentioned. He was dead by late 54 BC, when his death is said to have been a cause of indignation among the Germans. How he died is unknown. Tacitus notes that to flee from battle, abandoning one's shield, was shameful among the Germans, and those who did so often hung themselves; and that traitors and deserters were hung, and cowards drowned.</English>

		<German>[H1]Ariovist[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Ariovist (gestorben um 54 v. Chr.) war ein F&#252;rst der germanischen Sueben im 1. Jahrhundert v. Chr. und Gegner des Gaius Iulius Caesar im Gallischen Krieg. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Ariovists genaue Herkunft ist unbekannt. Seine gallischen (keltischen) Sprachkenntnisse sollen f&#252;r einen Germanen ungew&#246;hnlich gewesen sein. Um das Jahr 71 v. Chr. &#252;berschritt Ariovist mit ca. 15.000 Mann den Oberrhein und fiel in Gallien ein. Angeworben von den gallischen Sequanern und Arvernern, sollten seine Truppen diese im Streit um die Vorherrschaft in Gallien den Kampf gegen die Haeduer unterst&#252;tzen. 61 v. Chr. besiegte Ariovist die gallischen Haeduer und machte sie tributpflichtig. Die Haeduer riefen das mit ihnen verb&#252;ndete R&#246;mische Reich zur Hilfe, dieses blieb jedoch wegen innenpolitischer Auseinandersetzungen passiv. Der r&#246;mische Senat ernannte Ariovist sogar zum "Freund des r&#246;mischen Volkes". Der Grund daf&#252;r ist unklar, zeigt aber dennoch seine Bedeutung bereits vor dem Eingreifen Caesars in Gallien. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Vermutlich war Ariovist auch auf der Suche nach neuem Siedlungsgebiet, denn Caesar berichtet, dass er weitere Germanen &#252;ber den Rhein holen lie&#223;, bis sich deren Zahl auf angeblich 120.000 erh&#246;ht habe. Diese besetzten nun auch ein Drittel des fruchtbaren Gebietes der Sequaner und forderten ein weiteres Drittel ein. Ariovist lie&#223; Angeh&#246;rige der germanischen V&#246;lker der Haruden, Vangionen, Triboker, Segusier, Markomannen und Nemeter im neu erworbenen Gebiet ansiedeln, um seine Herrschaft zu untermauern. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Die Gallier baten nun Caesar gemeinsam um Hilfe. Diesem war klar, dass eine gr&#246;&#223;ere Anzahl Germanen in Gallien fr&#252;her oder sp&#228;ter auch das r&#246;mische Reich bedrohte und er handeln m&#252;sse. Caesar schickte Gesandte zu Ariovist und forderte ihn auf, keine weiteren germanischen St&#228;mme &#252;ber den Rhein zu bringen, Geiseln der Haeduer freizulassen und die Haeduer und ihre Verb&#252;ndeten in Frieden zu lassen. Ariovist lie&#223; im Gegenzug selbstbewusst ausrichten, dass auch die R&#246;mer sich nicht vorschreiben lie&#223;en, wie sie sich als Sieger zu verhalten h&#228;tten. Er ginge einer milit&#228;rischen Konfrontation nicht aus dem Weg. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Caesar nutzte dies wie schon zuvor sein Eingreifen gegen die Helvetier als Vorwand, um im noch von den R&#246;mern unbesetzten gallischen L&#228;ndereien zu intervenieren. Er besetzte zun&#228;chst die sequanische Hauptstadt Vesontio, aufgrund ihrer Befestigung ein strategisch wichtiges Ziel, und versorgte seine Truppen. Hier h&#246;rten seine Truppen zum ersten Mal von der ungeheuren Gr&#246;&#223;e und dem furchterregendem Blick ihrer Gegner, so dass sie es mit der Angst zu tun bekamen. Nur aufgrund einer flammenden Rede konnte Caesar seine Legionen von einer Meuterei abhalten. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]In einer Schlacht in der N&#228;he des Rheins, vermutlich im Gebiet des heutigen Elsass bei M&#252;lhausen, bei der angeblich 80.000 Germanen fielen, schlug Caesar 58 v. Chr. Ariovist und sein aus Angeh&#246;rigen von sieben St&#228;mmen bestehendes Heer. Dieser floh mit wenigen Kriegern &#252;ber den Rhein zur&#252;ck nach Germanien. Danach wird nur mehr berichtet, dass im Jahre 54 v. Chr. die Germanen um ihn getrauert h&#228;tten.</German>

The Marcomanni had been beaten utterly by the Romans in 10 BC. About 9 BC Marbod returned to Germany and became ruler of his people. To deal with the threat of Roman expansion into the Rhine-Danube basin he led the Marcomanni to the area later known as Bohemia to be outside the range of the Roman influence. There he took the title of a king and organized a confederation of several neighboring Germanic tribes. He was the first historical ruler of Bohemia. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Its possible that during his younger years, Maroboduus may have served as a prefect of auxiliaries in the Roman Army. This could explain the formidability of the disciplined Marcomanni army during his reign. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Augustus planned in 6 AD to destroy the mighty kingdom of Maroboduus, which he considered to be too dangerous for the Romans. The later Emperor Tiberius commanded twelve legions to attack the Marcomanni. But the outbreak of the Great Illyrian revolt in the back of the Romans forced Tiberius to conclude a treaty with Maroboduus and to recognize him as king. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Rivalry between him and Arminius, the Cheruscan leader who inflicted the devastating defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest on the Romans under Publius Quinctilius Varus in 9 AD, prevented a concerted attack on Roman territory across the Rhine in the north (by Arminius) and in the Danube basin in the south (by Maroboduus). [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]However, according to the 1st century AD historian Marcus Velleius Paterculus, Arminius sent Varus? head to Maroboduus. But the king of the Marcomanni sent it to Augustus. In the revenge war of Tiberius and Germanicus against the Cherusci Maroboduus stayed neutral. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]In 17 AD, war broke out between Arminius and Maroboduus, and after an indecisive battle Maroboduus withdrew into the area now known as Bohemia in 18 AD. In the next year Catualda, a nobleman, who had been exiled by Maroboduus, returned ? perhaps by a subversive Roman intervention ? and defeated Maroboduus. The deposed king had to flee to Italy and Tiberius detained him 18 years in Ravenna. There Maroboduus died in 37 AD.</English>

		<German>[H1]Marbod[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Marbod, lateinisch Maroboduus, (geboren um 30 v. Chr.; gestorben 37 n. Chr. in Ravenna) war der bedeutendste markomannische Herrscher. Im Jahre 8 v. Chr. wurde Marbod K&#246;nig der Markomannen, eines suebischen Volksstammes der Germanen, der im Maingebiet siedelte. In seiner Jugendzeit soll er lange in Rom gelebt haben und sich der Gunst des Kaisers Augustus erfreut haben. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]K&#246;nig Marbod, der erstmals in der germanischen Geschichte einen gr&#246;&#223;eren, ansatzweise zentralistisch gef&#252;hrten Herrschaftskomplex errichtet hatte, gebot &#252;ber ein angeblich nach r&#246;mischer Taktik und Disziplin geschultes Heer. Nach r&#246;mischem Vorbild lie&#223; er sich einen befestigten K&#246;nigssitz namens Marobudum bauen, der bis heute nicht genau lokalisiert werden konnte. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Anf&#228;nglich waren die Beziehungen zwischen Rom und dem Marbodreich eher gespannt. Es gab zun&#228;chst diplomatische Drohungen und fl&#252;chtige Aufst&#228;ndische fanden bei den Markomannen Zuflucht. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Arminius bot Marbod nach der Varusschlacht 9 n. Chr. ein B&#252;ndnis gegen die R&#246;mer an und sandte ihm daher das Haupt des Publius Quinctilius Varus, das der Markomannenherrscher jedoch Augustus ausliefern lie&#223; und somit eine germanische Koalition ausschlug. Trotzdem erkannte Rom Marbod nie als offiziell verb&#252;ndeten Klientelherrscher an. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Ein vom Markomannenk&#246;nig einst vertriebener Adliger, Catualda, der zu den Gotonen (Goten) gefl&#252;chtet war, kam jetzt mit einem gr&#246;&#223;eren Truppenaufgebot zur&#252;ck und gewann andere markomannische Adlige durch Bestechung f&#252;r seine Unterst&#252;tzung. So konnte Catualda den K&#246;nigssitz und die Festung von Marbod erobern. Dieser suchte sein Heil in der Flucht &#252;ber die Donau nach Noricum bei den R&#246;mern. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Der Kaiser war aber zum Angebot eines sicheren Geleit zur Grenze zur&#252;ck oder eines w&#252;rdigen Asyls in Italien bereit. Marbod entschied sich f&#252;r letzteres und wurde in Ravenna festgesetzt, wo er 18 Jahre sp&#228;ter starb. Eine Gedenktafel f&#252;r Marbod fand Aufnahme in die Walhalla bei Regensburg.</German>

C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nacido en una noble familia marcomana, de joven vivi&#243; en Italia, donde se atrajo el favor del emperador Augusto. Alrededor del a&#241;o 9 a.

All&#237; tom&#243; el t&#237;tulo de rey y organiz&#243; una confederaci&#243;n de varias tribus germ&#225;nicas vecinas. Fue el primer gobernante hist&#243;rico de Bohemia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Augusto plane&#243; el a&#241;o 6 destruir el poderoso reino de Marbod, que consideraba peligroso para Roma, ya que inici&#243; un proceso de colonizaci&#243;n de la Germania, llevando sus tropas hasta el r&#237;o Albis, actual Elba. De esta forma la Bohemia qued&#243; rodeada por los romanos, y el general romano Tiberio empez&#243; a trazar detallados planes para asaltar el reino de los marcomanos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Desde el 1 d. C. hasta el 6 d. C. Tiberio pacific&#243; toda la Germania, prepar&#225;ndose para el inminente asalto contra Marbod. Finalmente, Tiberio dispuso que el ej&#233;rcito del Danubio al mando suyo y de Valerio Mesalino atacar&#237;a desde Dalmacia y Panonia, mientras que las tropas del Rin al mando de Sentio Saturnino deb&#237;an abrirse paso a trav&#233;s de la Selva Hercinia hasta llegar al centro del reino. En total Tiberio contaba con doce legiones romanas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sin embargo, Marbod se hab&#237;a preparado ya para esta situaci&#243;n y hab&#237;a mantenido todos esos a&#241;os a sus tropas en constante entrenamiento. Para el momento del asalto romano pose&#237;a 75.000 guerreros. Cuando las tropas romanas estaban a cinco d&#237;as de lo que ser&#237;a un dif&#237;cil asalto, una rebeli&#243;n estall&#243; en la retaguardia, en Iliria, Dalmacia y Panonia. Tiberio suspendi&#243; el ataque y tuvo que buscar una tregua apresurada con Marbod, al que reconoci&#243; como rey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el a&#241;o 9 a. C., Arminio, rey de los queruscos, expuls&#243; a los romanos de Germania, y busc&#243; establecer una confederaci&#243;n con todos los pueblos germanos, incluyendo a los marc&#243;manos. Para ganarse el favor de Marbod, le envi&#243; la cabeza del gobernador romano, Varo, que hab&#237;a sido derrotado en la Batalla del bosque de Teutoburgo. Marbod, por su parte, se la entreg&#243; a los romanos. En la guerra de venganza que dirigieron Tiberio y Germ&#225;nico contra los queruscos, Marbod permaneci&#243; neutral.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La constante rivalidad entre Arminio y Marbod hizo que estallara la guerra entre ambos en el a&#241;o 17. Marbod, que se hab&#237;a estado extendiendo m&#225;s all&#225; de Bohemia, tuvo que replegarse de nuevo. Al a&#241;o siguiente, Catualda, un noble exiliado por Marbod, volvi&#243; con probable intervenci&#243;n subversiva romana y le derrot&#243;. El depuesto rey huy&#243; a Italia, donde Tiberio le retuvo durante 18 a&#241;os en R&#225;vena, donde muri&#243; en el a&#241;o 37.</Spanish>

[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Gegen Ende des Jahres 14 oder zu Anfang des Jahres 15 entf&#252;hrte Arminius, Sohn des cheruskischen Gaugrafen Segimer, wohl mit ihrem Einverst&#228;ndnis, die Tochter des den R&#246;mern nahe stehenden cheruskischen Gaugrafen Segestes und heiratete sie. Dies versch&#228;rfte die Spannungen zwischen den beiden Familien und f&#252;hrte zu gewaltsamen Auseinandersetzungen. Dabei gelang es Segestes Arminius in seine Gewalt zu bringen und ihn einige Zeit gefangen zu halten. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Arminius kam schlie&#223;lich wieder frei, aber Thusnelda ging nicht zu ihrem Vater zur&#252;ck. Dieser lie&#223; sie daraufhin im Jahre 15 entf&#252;hren ? sie war inzwischen im fortgeschrittenen Zustand der Schwangerschaft ? und auf seinen befestigten Gaugrafensitz, m&#246;glicherweise die Eresburg bei Obermarsberg oder auch den Desenberg bei Warburg, bringen. Arminius belagerte Segestes dort, ohne jedoch Erfolg zu haben. Es gelang Segestes, eine Gesandtschaft zu den R&#246;mern in K&#246;ln oder Xanten zu schicken, woraufhin Germanicus in das Gebiet der Cherusker einmarschierte und den Belagerungsring um Segestes sprengte.

Segestes, who favored Roman overlordship, bore Arminius a lifelong grudge and eventually found ways to exact his revenge. In 9 AD he warned the Roman governor Publius Quinctilius Varus of the impending uprising of his countrymen, but was not believed. Varus and his three legions subsequently perished in the three-day Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, where several allied German tribes under the command of Arminius ambushed them. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Segestes openly turned against Arminius when Germanicus invaded northern Germany in 15 AD in a renewed attempt to establish Roman rule in the area. Besieged in his stronghold by his own countrymen, Segestes appealed for help to Germanicus who relieved him, and Segestes then handed over his pregnant daughter Thusnelda, Arminius? wife, to Germanicus as a prisoner. Thusnelda was taken to Rome and, together with her brother Segimundus, displayed in Germanicus? victory parade in 17 AD, with her father an honored spectator. Thusnelda never returned to her homeland. Arminius? only son, Thumelicus, whom she bore while in captivity, was trained as a gladiator in Ravenna and died in a gladiator fight before reaching the age of 20. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]The final blow was delivered in 21 AD when Segestes and other members of his family murdered Arminius. Segestes was eventually given a residence by Germanicus somewhere in the Roman provinces west of the Rhine (Gaul).</Spanish>

[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Darius organized the empire by dividing it into provinces and placing satraps to govern it.

[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Durch Kriege und vorangegangene heftige Thronstreitigkeiten war das Perserreich offenbar in eine Krise geraten. Doch Dareios III., der sich zuvor als Feldherr und tapferer Soldat ausgezeichnet hatte, erwies sich rasch als tatkr&#228;ftiger Herrscher, der sich daran machte, das Reich wieder zu stabilisieren. Innerhalb kurzer Zeit entledigte er sich seines &#252;berm&#228;chtigen Gro&#223;wesirs Bagoas und unterdr&#252;ckte eine Revolte in &#196;gypten. Die makedonischen Truppen, die 336 v.

Dareios III. unterlag hier dem Angriff des makedonischen K&#246;nigs und musste das Schlachtfeld verlassen, um nicht in Gefangenschaft zu geraten. Seine Familie-darunter seine Mutter und seine Frauen-fielen in die H&#228;nde des Feindes. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Doch Dareios III. gab nicht auf, sondern bereitete die Entscheidungsschlacht sorgf&#228;ltig und entschlossen vor.

		<English>[H1]Philip II[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Philip II (382-336 BCE) was a Macedonian king who created the military, political &#38; cultural order that his son, Alexander, used to transform the history of the eastern Mediterranean &#38; western Asia. Philip was himself personally responsible for reversing the crumbling political power of Macedonia in the central Balkan peninsula through his reorganization of the army &#38; invention of the long pike (sarissa), a weapon that gave his phalanx a formidable advantage over enemy forces. Though initially regarded by Greeks as a barbarian, Philip, a master of diplomacy as well as military tactics, became the self-appointed peace-keeper among the feuding city states of Greece. As champion of a Pan Hellenic order, he forged a league to expel Persians from Greek cities in western Asia Minor. Though Philip himself was killed before achieving that goal, Alexander quickly turned his father?s achievements &#38; vision into a whirlwind campaign that gave Macedonians control of the whole Persian empire. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Prior to his unexpected accession to the Macedonian throne in 359 BCE, none would have anticipated such a pivotal role for the third son of Amyntas III, a ruler whose kingdom was disintegrating due to insubordination &#38; invasions. Philip had himself spent the previous decade (370-360 BCE) as a hostage in Thebes, the strongest Greek city state at the time, where he learned Greek military tactics. Soon after his return to Pella (the capitol of Macedonia) at age 22, Philip had to use experiences learned from the Greeks to retrain &#38; rebuild a Macedonian army that had suffered a defeat in which their king [Philip?s older brother] had been killed. In the following decade he not only regained control of territory lost by his predecessors but he intervened in Greece to resolve the so-called "sacred war" between Greek city states over the control of the temple of Apollo &#38; oracle of Delphi (346 BCE). As reward for having established peace at the religious center of the Greek world, he was not only admitted to membership in the Delphic confederacy but elected leader of its council, an unprecedented honor for a foreigner. Some, including the Athenian Isocrates, urged him to lead a Greek coalition against Persia. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Philip?s growing influence in Greece, however, earned the resentment of Athenian leaders who saw him as a threat to their preeminent role in Greek politics. Inflamed by the anti-Macedonian rhetoric of Demosthenes, Athens declared war on Philip in 340 BCE. When Thebes joined the Athenians to block Philip?s army from reaching Athens, Philip crushed their combined forces at Chaeronea (2 August 338 BCE), due in part to the young Alexander?s shrewd deployment of the cavalry to outflank the larger Greek army. Though a triumphant Philip occupied Thebes and spared Athens. To commemorate his victory Philip erected a shrine (called the Philippeon) at Olympia containing gold &#38; ivory statues of himself &#38; his family, to claim a place among the heroes &#38; gods of Greek myth. Instead of seeking reprisals against Greek opponents, he formed the Corinthian League (337 BCE), a council with representation from all Greek city states (except Sparta) with himself as its leader (hegemon). Yet this peace-making role of the Corinthian league was only a means for Philip to unite Greek forces to drive the Persians out of Ionia [Greek Asia Minor]--a plan he devised but did not live to realize. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Unfortunately, Philip?s impressive military &#38; political achievements demonstrating his uncommon restraint &#38; foresight in public policy were offset by incautious folly in his personal life. In 338 BCE he repudiated Alexander?s non-Macedonian mother, Olympias, to marry the younger Cleopatra, the daughter of a powerful Macedonian noble. Alexander left Macedonia with his mother, jeopardizing the line of succession. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]A lusty bon vivant noted for excessive drinking &#38; debauchery, Philip?s end came unexpectedly at a lavish celebration he had staged for his daughter?s wedding to the king of Epirus, Alexander?s uncle.

Ironically, the procession that implied his inclusion among the Greek pantheon of immortals had barely concluded, when Philip was assassinated by Pausanius, a disgruntled favorite, as he entered the theater.

When Thebes joined the Athenians to block Philip?s army from reaching Athens, Philip crushed their combined forces at Chaeronea (2 August 338 BCE), due in part to the young Alexander?s shrewd deployment of the cavalry to outflank the larger Greek army. Though a triumphant Philip occupied Thebes and spared Athens. To commemorate his victory Philip erected a shrine (called the Philippeon) at Olympia containing gold &#38; ivory statues of himself &#38; his family, to claim a place among the heroes &#38; gods of Greek myth. Instead of seeking reprisals against Greek opponents, he formed the Corinthian League (337 BCE), a council with representation from all Greek city states (except Sparta) with himself as its leader (hegemon). Yet this peace-making role of the Corinthian league was only a means for Philip to unite Greek forces to drive the Persians out of Ionia [Greek Asia Minor]--a plan he devised but did not live to realize. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Unfortunately, Philip?s impressive military &#38; political achievements demonstrating his uncommon restraint &#38; foresight in public policy were offset by incautious folly in his personal life. In 338 BCE he repudiated Alexander?s non-Macedonian mother, Olympias, to marry the younger Cleopatra, the daughter of a powerful Macedonian noble. Alexander left Macedonia with his mother, jeopardizing the line of succession. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]A lusty bon vivant noted for excessive drinking &#38; debauchery, Philip?s end came unexpectedly at a lavish celebration he had staged for his daughter?s wedding to the king of Epirus, Alexander?s uncle. The wedding feast concluded with a festal procession bearing statues of the 12 Olympian gods followed by a statue of Philip himself enthroned. Ironically, the procession that implied his inclusion among the Greek pantheon of immortals had barely concluded, when Philip was assassinated by Pausanius, a disgruntled favorite, as he entered the theater. Though rumors that Olympias and/or Alexander instigated Philip?s murder were accepted by some ancient biographers (e.g., Satyrus), modern critical historians generally consider such a conspiracy to be improbable.</Italian>

[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]He was attached to Sulla in his war against Marius, and behaved with great prudence and valor, and with such remarkable success that, on the restoration of peace in Italy, the conduct of the war against the remains of the Marian faction in Africa and Sicily was entrusted to him.

His next exploits were the reduction of the followers of Lepidus, whom he drove out of Italy, and the extinction of the Marian party in Spain, led on by the brave Sertorius. In returning to Italy after an absence of five or six years in Spain, he fell in with and defeated the remnants of the army of Spartacus, and thus claimed the credit of concluding the Servile war.

[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]In 67-66 B.C., Pompey performed a noble service to the republic in clearing the Mediterranean of the pirates who infested it in great numbers; and during the next four years 65-62 he conquered Mithridates, King of Pontus, Tigranes, King of Armenia, and Antiochus, King of Syria.

[NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Later, having quarrelled with the Senate, he joined with Caesar and Crassus in forming a coalition, which is commonly called "The First Triumvirate," and which for a time frustrated all the efforts of the aristocratic party.

And now for some years following, Caesar was reaping laurels in Gaul, and rising higher in popular esteem as a warrior and statesman, while Pompey was idly wasting his time and energies at Rome. But Pompey could not bear a rival. Jealousies sprang up; Julia died in 54 B.C., and thus father-in-law and son in-law were sundered by a yet wider gulf, which no bridge could span. Pompey now returned to his former friends, the aristocracy, whose great desire was to check Caesar?s views, and strip him of his command. Caesar was ordered to lay down his office and return to Rome, which he consented to do provided Pompey, who had an army near Rome, would do the same. The Senate insisted on an unconditional resignation, and ordered him to disband his army by a certain day, otherwise he would be declared a public enemy. It was on this memorable occasion that he crossed the Rubicon, and thus defied the Senate and its armies, which were under Pompey?s command.

		<German>[H1]Pompeius[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (auch Pompejus genannt; 106-48 v. Chr. bei Pelusium) war ein r&#246;mischer Politiker und Feldherr, bekannt als Gegenspieler Gaius Iulius Caesars. Er galt bis zu seiner Niederlage gegen Caesar als der brillanteste Heerf&#252;hrer seiner Zeit (der Beiname Magnus, deutsch "der Gro&#223;e", spielt auf Alexander den Gro&#223;en an), scheiterte aber immer wieder an den innenpolitischen Mechanismen Roms, in die er sich nie v&#246;llig einf&#252;gen wollte und konnte. Bedeutsam &#252;ber seine Zeit hinaus waren manche seiner organisatorischen Ma&#223;nahmen, die das sp&#228;tere Kaiserreich vorwegnahmen. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Als Caesar den Rubikon &#252;berschritt, den Grenzfluss seiner Provinz Gallia Cisalpina, brach der B&#252;rgerkrieg aus. Pompeius wurde vom Senat beauftragt, die Stadt Rom zu besch&#252;tzen. Doch Pompeius wusste, dass seine Streitkr&#228;fte in Italien zu schwach waren. Zwar unterstanden ihm zehn Legionen, aber der Gro&#223;teil dieses Heers war in Spanien stationiert und nicht schnell genug verf&#252;gbar. Au&#223;erdem war er sich sicher, dass Caesar nicht nur mit einer Legion einmarschieren w&#252;rde, sondern mit seinem gesamten Heer. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Auch war Pompeius sich des R&#252;ckhaltes der italischen St&#228;dte zu unsicher gewesen. Selbst viele seiner Verb&#252;ndeten aus dem Lager der Optimaten wollten sich ihm nicht unterordnen, weil sie die Konzentration der milit&#228;rischen Macht auf eine Person f&#252;r unrepublikanisch hielten. Erst Ende des Jahres 49 v. Chr. wurde Pompeius der Oberbefehl &#252;bertragen, doch bestand die Zerstrittenheit in seinem Lager fort. Der charismatische Caesar dagegen konnte sich auf die Treue seiner Legionen st&#252;tzen, die sich ihm pers&#246;nlich verbunden f&#252;hlten (Heeresklientel). Die Uneinigkeit zwischen Pompeius und den &#252;brigen Senatoren und Amtstr&#228;gern sollte sich vor allem in der Schlacht von Pharsalos r&#228;chen. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Pompeius r&#228;umte die Stadt Rom und zog mit einigen ihm treu ergebenen Senatoren nach Brundisium, um sich gen Griechenland zu verschiffen. Caesar konnte seine &#220;berfahrt nach Griechenland trotz Belagerung nicht verhindern. Pompeius versuchte, die ihm treu ergebenen Truppen im Osten zu erreichen und alle seine Klienten zu verpflichten. Caesar wandte sich erst nach Spanien und nahm weitgehend kampflos die St&#228;dte dort ein. W&#228;hrenddessen war es Pompeius m&#246;glich, gro&#223;e Truppen auszuheben. Es gab Bef&#252;rchtungen, dass er damit in Italien landen wolle, um Caesar zu stellen. Dies bewahrheitete sich allerdings nicht. Pompeius verbrachte den Winter in Thessaloniki. Er bewegte sich erst in Richtung Westen, als Caesar bereit war, das Ionische Meer zu &#252;berqueren. Dieses wurde von Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus bewacht, dem Caesar allerdings erfolgreich auswich. Caesar setzte im Januar 48 v. Chr. nach Griechenland &#252;ber und beide Armeen marschierten nach Dyrrhachium, wo Caesar in der Schlacht von Dyrrhachium an den Rand einer Niederlage geriet. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Pompeius, der sein milit&#228;risches K&#246;nnen bereits mehrfach unter Beweis gestellt hatte, versuchte eine Entscheidungsschlacht zu vermeiden, wurde aber von den Senatoren dazu gezwungen. In der Schlacht von Pharsalos in Thessalien erlitt Pompeius am 9. August 48 v. Chr. eine vernichtende Niederlage. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Nach der Niederlage in Pharsalos floh Pompeius nach &#196;gypten, wo ihn die H&#246;flinge des Kindk&#246;nigs Ptolemaios XIII. am 28. September, einen Tag vor dem 58. Geburtstag des Feldherrn, ermorden lie&#223;en. Sein abgeschlagener Kopf wurde sp&#228;ter Caesar &#252;bergeben.</German>

		<English>[H1]Crassus[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Crassus (Marcus Licinius Crassus), son of Publius Licinius Crassus (consul 97 BC), escaped from Cinna to Spain, joined Sulla after Cinna?s death, played a prominent part in regaining Italy for him, and made a fortune in Sulla?s proscriptions. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]After his praetorship he defeated Spartacus (72?71 BC), but Pompey, after crucifying many fugitives, claimed credit for the victory, deeply offending Crassus. Formally reconciled, they were made consuls 70 and presided over the abolition of Sulla?s political settlement, though his administrative reforms were retained. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]During the next few years Crassus further increased his fortune and, relying on his connections, financial power, and astuteness, gained considerable influence. After 67, overshadowed by Pompey?s commands (which he had opposed), he is associated by our sources with various schemes to expand his power and perhaps gain a military command. As censor 65, he tried to enrol the Transpadanes as citizens and to have Egypt annexed; he was foiled by his colleague Quintus Lutatius Catulus and their quarrel forced both to abdicate. Always ready to help eminent or promising men in need of aid, he shielded the suspects in the "first conspiracy" of Catiline and supported Catiline until the latter turned to revolution and a programme of cancelling debts. He may have supported the law of Publius Servilius Rullus. A patron of Julius Caesar (without, however, detaching him from Pompey), he enabled him to leave for his province in 62 by standing surety for part of his debts. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]On Caesar?s return, he was persuaded by him to give up his opposition to Pompey, which during 62?60 had prevented both of them from gaining their political objectives, and to join Pompey in supporting Caesar?s candidacy for the consulship. As consul (59), Caesar satisfied him by passing legislation to secure remission of one third of the sum owed by the publicani of Asia for their contract (Crassus presumably had an interest in their companies), and he now joined Pompey and Caesar in an open political alliance. After Caesar?s departure for Gaul he supported Clodius, who soon proved to be too ambitious to make a reliable ally and tried to embroil him with Pompey and Cicero. He welcomed Cicero on his return from exile, but in 56 alerted Caesar to the attempts by Cicero and others to recall him and attach Pompey to the optimates. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Late in 55, ignoring the solemn curses of the tribune Gaius Ateius Capito, Crassus left for Syria, determined on a war of conquest against Parthia. He won some early successes in 54 and completed financial preparations by extorting huge sums in his province. In 53 he crossed the Euphrates, relying on his long neglected military skills and the recent ones of his son Publius Licinius Crassus. Although deserted by Artavasdes of Armenia and the king of Osroene, he continued his advance into unfamiliar territory. After Publius died in a rash action, he himself was caught in Surenas (the Parthian king?s hereditary commander) near Carrhae and, trying to extricate himself, died fighting. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]His death helped to bring Caesar and Pompey into the confrontation that led to the Civil War.</English>

		<German>[H1]Crassus[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Marcus Licinius Crassus war ein General und Staatsmann, er begr&#252;ndete gemeinsam mit Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus und Gaius Julius C&#228;sar das 1. Triumvirat. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]W&#228;hrend des ersten B&#252;rgerkrieges schloss sich Crassus 83 v. Chr. Lucius Cornelius Sulla, dem F&#252;hrer der Optimaten, im Kampf gegen die Popularen bzw. Marianer an und zeichnete sich als Befehlshaber in der entscheidenden Schlacht am Collinischen Tor im November 82 v. Chr. aus. Nach Sullas Sieg bereicherte sich Crassus bei den Proskriptionen, durch die Sulla seine politischen Gegner ausschaltete, gewissenlos, h&#228;ufte ein riesiges Verm&#246;gen an, handelte aber auch zunehmend eigenm&#228;chtig, weshalb er 81 v. Chr. vor&#252;bergehend politisch in Ungnade fiel. Seinen Reichtum, er wurde schlie&#223;lich der reichste Mann von Rom, setzte er gezielt daf&#252;r ein, sich als einflussreicher Patron, der die f&#252;hrenden Familien Roms finanziell von sich abh&#228;ngig gemacht hatte, in den politischen Wirren der Endphase der R&#246;mischen Republik Macht und politische &#196;mter zu erwerben und zu sichern. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]71 v. Chr. schlug Crassus, im Amt des Prokonsuls, den Sklavenaufstand des Spartakus nieder. Ein Jahr sp&#228;ter wurde er, neben Pompeius, Konsul, geriet jedoch bald mit diesem in Konflikt, welcher trotz der wenig sp&#228;ter erfolgten Auss&#246;hnung latent bestehen blieb. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]65 v. Chr. amtierte Crassus als Zensor, als der er sich mit seinen Vorhaben allerdings nicht gegen seinen Mitzensoren Quintus Lutatius Catulus durchsetzen konnte. Um diese Zeit begann er auch die Machenschaften des Catilina zu f&#246;rdern, und als sich Catilina 64 v. Chr. gegen Marcus Tullius Cicero um das Konsulat f&#252;r das Jahr 63 v. Chr. bewarb, unterst&#252;tzten er und Caesar Catilinas Kandidatur. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]60 v. Chr. agierte er im R&#246;mischen Senat gegen Pompeius, dessen Machtposition ihn, der selbst der Erste im Staat sein wollte, mit Neid erf&#252;llte, schloss sich dann aber, da er sich mit seinen Pl&#228;nen im Senat nicht durchsetzen konnte, mit Pompeius und Julius C&#228;sar im 1. Triumvirat zusammen. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Als Triumvir hatte er nun endlich eine ? wenn auch nicht gesetzlich sanktionierte ? f&#252;hrende Stellung im Staat inne. 57 v. Chr. brach der Konflikt zwischen Crassus und Pompeius wieder offen aus, doch C&#228;sar gelang es im folgenden Jahr, die beiden wieder miteinander zu vers&#246;hnen. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]55 v. Chr. war Crassus ein zweites Mal zusammen mit Pompeius Konsul, und f&#252;r die Zeit nach Ablauf seines Konsulatsjahres erhielt er als Prokonsul f&#252;r f&#252;nf Jahre die Provinz Syria sowie die Erlaubnis, Krieg gegen die Parther zu f&#252;hren. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Ende 55 v. Chr. reiste er nach Syrien ab, und 53 v. Chr. zog er von Syrien aus &#252;ber den Euphrat gegen die Parther. In der Gegend von Carrhae erlitt er eine schwere Niederlage gegen die Parther. Daraufhin zog er sich nach Carrhae zur&#252;ck, aber bevor er von dort aus seine Truppen nach Syrien zur&#252;ckf&#252;hren konnte, wurde er &#252;berfallen und get&#246;tet.</German>

		<German>Entscheidungen des Stammes wurden von allen freien und waffenf&#228;higen M&#228;nnern auf dem Thing, der Volksversammlung entschieden. Jeder hatte eine Stimme. Das Thing wurde zu festen Zeiten, bei Neumond oder Vollmond ohne Einladung oder in Notf&#228;llen mit Ladung abgehalten. Das der Mond mitspielte, hatte mit dem Glauben daran zu tun, das er auf gewisse Entscheidungen einen g&#252;nstigen Einfluss nahm. W&#228;hrend der Verhandlungen war Schweigen geboten. Das Thing fand im Freien, meist an einer heiligen St&#228;tte statt, wurde durch einen feierlichen Akt geweiht und damit unter den G&#246;tterfrieden gestellt. Eine Verletzung des Thingfriedens war ein schwerer Frevel gegen die G&#246;tter und wurde durch die Priester bestraft. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Das Thing war zun&#228;chst Heeresversamlmung und entschied &#252;ber Frieden und Krieg. Aber hier erfolgte auch die Wehrhaftmachung der jungen M&#228;nner, mit der sie zwar nicht aus der Munt des Vaters entlassen wurden, aber ins Heer aufgenommen und zum Thing zugelassen. Auch die Freilassung von Unfreien und ihre Eingliederung in die Gesellschaft oblag der Versammlung, genauso wie hier &#252;ber schwere Vergehen gerichtet wurde, wie etwa Friedensbruch, Landverrat oder G&#246;tterfrevel. Ging es um politische Verhandlungen, so besprachen sie vorab die &#196;ltesten. Die Abstimmungen &#252;ber Kriegsz&#252;ge und &#228;hnliches wurden durch Waffenzusammenschlagen oder Murren entschieden. Ein K&#246;nig &#228;nderte nichts an diesen Verfahrensweise.

Rechtskr&#228;ftig wurde die Wahl, wenn der Gew&#228;hlte auf den Schild gehoben wurde und das Volk ihm zujubelte. Erf&#252;llte er seine Pflichten nicht, wurde er kurzerhand abgesetzt, verjagt oder sogar erschlagen. Der K&#246;nig war also nie alleiniger und uneingeschr&#228;nkter Herrscher.

		<German>Gar finster und mystisch schildert der r&#246;mische Dichter Lucanus (39-65 n.Chr.) einen keltischen heiligen Hain mit Quellen: " Da stand ein Hain, seit Menschengedenken niemals entweiht. Mit verschr&#228;nkten Zweigen bildete er einen Bereich voller Dunkelheit und Schatten, dessen Kuppel nie von den Strahlen der Sonne durchbrochen wurde. [...] Die Alt&#228;re waren mit gr&#228;sslichen Schlachtb&#228;nken versehen und die B&#228;ume von menschlichem Blut befleckt.

		<Spanish>La sociedad celta era de car&#225;cter tribal y aristocr&#225;tico. Los grupos m&#225;s importantes de la poblaci&#243;n eran los sacerdotes (druidas) y los guerreros; a los dem&#225;s apenas se les conced&#237;a importancia. Los sacerdotes celtas no pon&#237;an por escrito sus conocimientos. Ello obedec&#237;a a un prop&#243;sito deliberado por su parte; quer&#237;an de este modo evitar que su sistema de ense&#241;anza se divulgara entre la gente com&#250;n. Como consecuencia de esta actitud no contamos con fuentes directas para el conocimiento de la religi&#243;n que practicaban los celtas. Muchos de los datos disponibles son meras deducciones y presentan numerosas lagunas. A pesar de todo, y a juzgar por lo poco que se sabe de ellos, se puede afirmar que los celtas se tomaban muy en serio su religi&#243;n. Hay escasos indicios de que el primitivo mundo celta contara con templos al estilo cl&#225;sico. Sin embargo, las &#250;ltimas excavaciones parecen sugerir que exist&#237;an m&#225;s construcciones de las que se supon&#237;a. De ah&#237; se deduce que en los diversos pa&#237;ses celtas hab&#237;a edificios bastante s&#243;lidos dedicados a la funci&#243;n de santuarios. Consist&#237;an en terraplenes y fosos de tierra, que en algunos casos cercaban unas plataformas sacrificiales pavimentadas de losas y con pozos rituales donde se depositaban ofrendas, huesos, cer&#225;mica y otros objetos. Uno de estos santuarios se halla situado en Libenice (Rep&#250;blica Checa). Otras construcciones por el estilo, consistentes en silos o pozos, que a veces alcanzan gran profundidad, rellenos de ofrendas y objetos de culto de muy diversos g&#233;neros, van apareciendo constantemente en todo el mundo celta. S&#243;lo en el sur de Francia hay restos de templos construidos en piedra, de estilo mediterr&#225;neo, pero este tipo de construcci&#243;n es esencialmente ajeno a los celtas. En general, los santuarios de los celtas parecen haber consistido en peque&#241;os terraplenes, con profundos pozos a cuyo alrededor se desarrollaban las ceremonias, y en emplazamientos naturales cuyo uso prolongado les confer&#237;a car&#225;cter sagrado. M&#225;s tarde, bajo el influjo de Roma, se construyeron templos dobles en piedra en los que eran venerados conjuntamente los dioses celtas y romanos, cuyas im&#225;genes y dedicatorias se hac&#237;an ya en estilo cl&#225;sico.</Spanish>

For that reason, other authors on the subject conclude that orichalcum is either the gold-copper alloy tumbaga, or possibly amber.</English>

Besonderes Interesse erregt der Oreichalkos, da ihn auch Platon in seinem Dialog "Kritias" erw&#228;hnt und dort als "feurig schimmerndes Metall" beschreibt. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Allgemein vermutet man unter Oreichalkos Messing, eine Legierung aus Kupfer und Zink, die in der fr&#252;hen Antike eher selten war und daher von Platon den Atlantiden zugeschrieben worden sein k&#246;nnte. Messing scheint sich vom Aussehen her mit Platons Beschreibung zu decken. Gegen Messing spricht, dass es kein abbaubares Erz, sondern eine Legierung ist und eigentlich erst in r&#246;mischer Zeit breitere Verwendung fand. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Im Neugriechischen bedeutet Oreichalkos ebenfalls Messing, seltener Bronze, was die Vermutung erh&#228;rtet, es k&#246;nnte in der Antike dasselbe bedeutet haben. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Die alten R&#246;mer &#252;bernahmen den Begriff als lat. Aurichalkum und bezeichneten damit eine messing&#228;hnliche Kupfer-Zink-Legierung von gold&#228;hnlicher Farbe, der man mehr Wert als reinem Kupfer beima&#223; und die zur M&#252;nzpr&#228;gung verwendet wurde.</German>
		<Italian>Orichalcum is a metal mentioned in several ancient writings, most notably the story of Atlantis as recounted in the Critias dialogue, recorded by Plato. [NEWLINE]The name derives from the Greek meaning "mountain copper" or "mountain metal". [NEWLINE]The Romans transliterated "orichalcum" as "aurichalcum", which was thought to literally mean "gold copper". It is known from the writings of Cicero that the metal they called orichalcum, while it resembled gold in colour, had a much lower value. [NEWLINE]In later years, "orichalcum" was used to describe the sulfide mineral chalcopyrite or brass. However, these are difficult to reconcile with the text of Critias, because he states that the metal was "only a name" by his time, while brass and chalcopyrite continued to be very important through the time of Plato until today. For that reason, other authors on the subject conclude that orichalcum is either the gold-copper alloy tumbaga, or possibly amber.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Orichalcum, Oricalco u Orihalcon es un metal legendario mencionado en escritos antiguos siendo los m&#225;s significativos los escritos de Plat&#243;n sobre la Atl&#225;ntida. Seg&#250;n estos escritos este metal ser&#237;a el segundo metal m&#225;s valioso y min&#243; por muchas parte de la Atl&#225;ntida. La palabra Orichalcum significa "cobre de monta&#241;a" y deriva del griego.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seg&#250;n estudios de muchos especialistas en metales e historiadores de la miner&#237;a, el oricalco u orichalcum no es m&#225;s que una aleaci&#243;n de cobre, zinc y plomo, muy probablemente el conocido como lat&#243;n dorado. Aunque es una aleaci&#243;n que hoy no consideremos m&#225;s valiosa que el oro y el platino, por aquel entonces era un metal con mucho valor en la religi&#243;n, el que se usaba para rendir culto a Poseid&#243;n y otros dioses de la antigua Grecia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sin embargo la referencia dada por Plat&#243;n en "Critias" elimina la posibilidad de que sea una aleaci&#243;n de metales, ya que: "Se le extra&#237;a de la tierra en muchos lugares de la isla" (Critias, 114). A la vista de esta descripci&#243;n algunos arque&#243;logos han pensado que el oricalco no era m&#225;s que el &#225;mbar: precisamente durante la Edad de Bronce final (s. XII-X a. C.) el &#225;mbar era uno de los principales productos que, desde la Pen&#237;nsula de Jutlandia, los nav&#237;os de Tartessos exportaban a todo el Mediterr&#225;neo junto con el esta&#241;o, el bronce y la plata.</Spanish>

		<English>Silphium (also known as silphion or laser) was a plant that was used in classical antiquity as a rich seasoning and as a medicine.

It was said that it could be used to treat cough, sore throat, fever, indigestion, aches and pains, warts, and all kinds of maladies. It has been speculated that the plant may also have functioned as a contraceptive, based partly on Pliny's statement that it could be used "to promote the menstrual discharge".

		<Spanish>El silfio o laserpicio en lat&#237;n, es una planta desaparecida desde principios de nuestra era, semejante a la asaf&#233;tida, muy valorada en la antig&#252;edad en la zona mediterr&#225;nea por su exudado resinoso (laser) usado por sus propiedades como medicamento y condimento gastron&#243;mico.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la actualidad la planta se cree desaparecida, si bien han sido propuestas algunas especies modernas como dicha planta o parientes muy pr&#243;ximos de esta. Por las descripciones, im&#225;genes conservadas y similitudes descritas se la considera generalmente como un miembro del g&#233;nero Ferula, a la que pertenece la asaf&#233;tida que ha sido propuesta como la posible identidad del laserpicio, ya que Estrab&#243;n usa el t&#233;rmino indistintamente con ambas plantas. Se sabe que la asaf&#233;tida era usada como sustituta de inferior calidad pero se ignora si era un suced&#225;neo o una variedad de la misma planta de menor calidad o elaboraci&#243;n menos cuidadosa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seg&#250;n Plinio el Viejo, que no lleg&#243; a conocer el laserpicio, la planta era silvestre e imposible de cultivar, con fuertes y abundantes ra&#237;ces y tallo similar al de la asaf&#233;tida y de grosor parecido. Las hojas, llamadas maspetum eran parecidas al perejil y la planta las mudaba cada a&#241;o. Otros autores mencionados por Plinio describen la planta con ra&#237;z de m&#225;s de un cubit de longitud y que mostraba una tuberosidad sobre la superficie de la tierra, sobre la que se alzaba el tallo llamado magidaris del que brotaban hojas doradas que se ca&#237;an durante el ascenso de la estrella del can (can&#237;cula), cuando el viento del sur se hace dominante. Seg&#250;n estos autores la planta se reproduc&#237;a tambi&#233;n a partir de estas hojas ca&#237;das, no s&#243;lo de las semillas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El nombre latino de la planta es laserpicium, de ella se extra&#237;a el laser, que era la resina arom&#225;tica que exudaba la planta. El laser se extra&#237;a tanto de la ra&#237;z como del tallo, recibiendo estos jugos los nombres de rizias y caulias respectivamente, siendo el &#250;ltimo de peor calidad y con tendencia a estropearse. Este flu&#237;do se vert&#237;a en recipientes sobre una capa de salvado y se dejaba madurar agit&#225;ndolo de cuando en cuando para evitar su putrefacci&#243;n. Se sab&#237;a cuando hab&#237;a madurado por el cambio de color y la desaparici&#243;n de la humedad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las causas de la extinci&#243;n se desconocen pero se piensa que se debi&#243; principalmente a la sobreexplotaci&#243;n debido a su alto valor y al incremento de la demanda, unida a los cambios clim&#225;ticos en el norte de &#193;frica, que se fue volviendo progresivamente m&#225;s &#225;rido desde la antig&#252;edad remota. La planta crec&#237;a en una franja de tierra muy estrecha en la costa flanqueada por el desierto. Adem&#225;s la planta s&#243;lo se recolectaba en estado salvaje, ya que Teofrasto afirmaba que no era posible cultivarla. Otro hecho que pudo influir fue el excesivo pastoreo en zonas donde crec&#237;a la planta, unido al hecho de que la carne del ganado que la consum&#237;a adquir&#237;a un sabor agradable, seg&#250;n Plinio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Diversas expediciones bot&#225;nicas han tenido lugar a lo largo de la historia con la finalidad de localizar la planta en el norte de &#193;frica, sin &#233;xito hasta la fecha.</Spanish>

		<German>Die Geschichte des Bieres reicht weit in die Geschichte der Menschheit zur&#252;ck: Bier ist eines der &#228;ltesten alkoholischen Getr&#228;nke. Es ist vermutlich der Menschheit bekannt, seit im Gebiet des Fruchtbaren Halbmondes Menschen begannen, vor etwa 10.000 Jahren Getreide zu sammeln und zuf&#228;llig entdeckten, dass Getreidebrei, den man einige Tage stehen lie&#223;, zu g&#228;ren anfing.

Auch die Arbeiter f&#252;r den Pyramidenbau erhielten t&#228;glich zwei Kr&#252;ge Bier, dazu drei bis vier Brote. Die Hieroglyphe f&#252;r Nahrung war lange Zeit ein Zeichen f&#252;r Brot und Bier.

		<Spanish>Se denomina cerveza (del celtolat&#237;n cerevis&#301;a ) a una bebida alcoh&#243;lica, no destilada, de sabor amargo que se fabrica con granos de cebada u otros cereales cuyo almid&#243;n es fermentado en agua con levadura (b&#225;sicamente Saccharomyces cerevisiae o S. carlsbergensis) y frecuentemente aromatizado con l&#250;pulo, entre otras plantas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]De ella se conocen m&#250;ltiples variantes con una amplia gama de matices debidos a las diferentes formas de elaboraci&#243;n y a los ingredientes utilizados. Generalmente presenta un color ambarino con tonos que van del amarillo oro al negro pasando por los marrones rojizos. Se la considera gaseosa (contiene CO2 disuelto en saturaci&#243;n que se manifiesta en forma de burbujas a la presi&#243;n ambiente) y suele estar coronada de una espuma m&#225;s o menos persistente. Su aspecto puede ser cristalino o turbio. Su graduaci&#243;n alcoh&#243;lica puede alcanzar hasta cerca de los 30% vol., aunque principalmente se encuentra entre los 3% y los 9% vol.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hist&#243;ricamente la cerveza fue desarrollada por los antiguos pueblos elamitas, egipcios y sumerios. Las evidencias m&#225;s antiguas de la producci&#243;n de cerveza datan de alrededor de 3500 a. C. fueron halladas en Godin Tepe, en el antiguo Elam (actual Ir&#225;n).

Seg&#250;n la receta m&#225;s antigua conocida, el Papiro de Z&#243;simo de Pan&#243;polis (siglo III), los egipcios elaboraban la cerveza a partir de panes de cebada poco cocidos que dejaban fermentar en agua. Su cerveza fue conocida como zythum, que es palabra griega, pero en una fase m&#225;s tard&#237;a. Antiguamente en Oriente se usaba arroz y tambi&#233;n bamb&#250;. Del bamb&#250;, lo mismo que de la ca&#241;a de az&#250;car, lo que se fermenta es su savia; pero no su fruto. Tal es el ulanzi propio de Tanzania. No puede ser considerado un fermentado alcoh&#243;lico de cereal. Las bebidas alcoh&#243;licas m&#225;s antiguas quiz&#225; sean derivadas de la leche.</Spanish>

		<English>Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc; the proportions of zinc and copper can be varied to create a range of brasses with varying properties. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Brass has a muted yellow color which is somewhat similar to gold. It is relatively resistant to tarnishing, and is often used as decoration and for coins. In antiquity, polished brass was often used as a mirror. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]The earliest brasses may have been natural alloys made by smelting zinc-rich copper ores. By the Roman period brass was being deliberately produced from metallic copper and zinc minerals using the cementation process and variations on this method continued until the mid 19th century. It was eventually replaced by speltering, the direct alloying of copper and zinc metal which was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]By the 8th?7th century BC Assyrian cuneiform tablets mention the exploitation of the "copper of the mountains" and this may refer to "natural" brass. Oreichalkos, the Ancient Greek translation of this term, was later adapted to the Latin aurichalcum meaning "golden copper" which became the standard term for brass. In the 4th century BC Plato knew oreichalkos as rare and nearly as valuable as gold and Pliny describes how aurichalcum had come from Cypriot ore deposits which had been exhausted by the 1st century AD. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]During the later part of first Millennium BC the use of brass spread across a wide geographical area from Britain and Spain in the west to Iran, and India in the east.

		<German>Messing ist die Sammelbezeichnung f&#252;r eine Gruppe von Legierungen mit den Hauptbestandteilen Kupfer und Zink. Die Farbe von Messing ist abh&#228;ngig vom Zinkgehalt und schwankt meist zwischen einem helleren und dunkleren Goldgelb mit gro&#223;er Farb&#228;hnlichkeit zu nat&#252;rlichem Gold. Bei Zinkgehalten unter 20 % wird Messing br&#228;unlich bis br&#228;unlich-r&#246;tlich und bei Gehalten &#252;ber 36 % hellgelb bis fast wei&#223;gelb. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Eine &#228;hnliche Legierung aus Kupfer und Zinn wird als Bronze bezeichnet. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Messing ist etwas h&#228;rter als reines Kupfer, jedoch nicht so hart wie Bronze. Die Messingschmelze ist d&#252;nnfl&#252;ssig und nimmt im Gegensatz zu reiner Kupferschmelze wenig Gase auf, l&#228;sst sich daher blasenarm gie&#223;en. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Messing war bereits etwa 3000 v. Chr. und im Raum Pal&#228;stina nachgewiesenerma&#223;en zwischen 1400 und 1000 v. Chr. bekannt. [NEWLINE] [NEWLINE]Schriftliche Zeugnisse vom Gebrauch des Messings lieferten unter anderem Cicero, der sich in seinem De officiis dar&#252;ber beklagte, dass die Unmoral vieler H&#228;ndler sie Messing anstelle von Gold verkaufen lie&#223;.

		<Spanish>El lat&#243;n, es una aleaci&#243;n de cobre y zinc. Las proporciones de cobre y zinc pueden variar para crear una variedad de latones con propiedades diversas. En los latones industriales el porcentaje de Zn se mantiene siempre inferior al 20%. Su composici&#243;n influye en las caracter&#237;sticas mec&#225;nicas, la fusibilidad y la capacidad de conformaci&#243;n por fundic&#237;&#243;n, forja, troquelado y mecanizado. En fr&#237;o, los lingotes obtenidos pueden transformarse en l&#225;minas de diferentes espesores, varillas o cortarse en tiras susceptibles de estirarse para fabricar alambres. Su densidad tambi&#233;n depende de su composici&#243;n. En general, la densidad del lat&#243;n ronda entre 8,4 g/cm3 y 8,7 g/cm3. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Si bien el bronce es, en cambio, principalmente una aleaci&#243;n de cobre con esta&#241;o, algunos tipos de latones se denominan 'bronces'. El lat&#243;n es una aleaci&#243;n sustitucional que se utiliza para decoraci&#243;n debido a que su brillo le da un aspecto similar al del oro, para aplicaciones en que se requiere baja fricci&#243;n, como cerraduras, v&#225;lvulas, etc. Para fontaner&#237;a y aplicaciones el&#233;ctricas, y extensamente en instrumentos musicales como trompetas y campanas, adem&#225;s de platillos de bajo coste (Power Beat, Paiste PST3, Planet Z) por sus propiedades ac&#250;sticas. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El lat&#243;n es conocido por el ser humano desde &#233;pocas prehist&#243;ricas, incluso antes de que el mismo zinc fuese descubierto. Entonces se produc&#237;a mediante la mezcla de cobre con calamina, una fuente natural de zinc. En las villas alemanas de Breinigerberg, un antiguo sitio romano, se descubri&#243; donde exist&#237;a una mina de calamina. Durante el proceso de mezclado, el zinc se extrae de la calamina y se mezcla con el cobre. El zinc puro, por otra parte, tiene un baj&#237;simo punto de fusi&#243;n como para haber sido producido por las t&#233;cnicas antiguas para el trabajo del metal. </Spanish>

		<German>Krebse tauchen in der Literatur erst im 5. Jh. v. Chr. auf. Die gr&#246;sseren Arten galten zu allen Zeiten als essbar und das Fleisch als sehr bek&#246;mmlich. Die Vielfalt der Krebse wurde in der Antike untersch&#228;tzt. Deshalb sind die Berichte meist nicht einer speziellen Art oder Gattung zuzuordnen. Trennungen erscheinen vor allem in Richtung Garnelen und Langusten. Von wirtschaftlicher Bedeutung war nur cammarus (Hummer), der im gesamten Mittelmeer gefangen wurde. Im Schwarzen Meer kam er nicht vor. Im Gegensatz zu heute war der Hummer in der Antike eine durchaus g&#228;ngige und beliebte Speise des Volkes.</German>
		<Italian>Crabs appear in literature from the 5th Century BC on. The larger species were at all times considered edible and the meat very digestible. The variety of cancers has been underestimated in the ancient world. Therefore, the reports usually are not assigned to a specific species or genus.

		<Spanish>Se llama cangrejos a diversos crust&#225;ceos del orden de los dec&#225;podos. Este orden, caracterizado por tener cinco pares de patas, incluye a los crust&#225;ceos de mayor tama&#241;o, como langostas, gambas y camarones, adem&#225;s de las diversas formas que se llaman cangrejos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lo que tienen en com&#250;n todos los llamados cangrejos es su car&#225;cter bent&#243;nico, es decir que viven vagando sobre el fondo. S&#243;lo algunas especies de la superfamilia Portunoidea han desarrollado secundariamente un h&#225;bito nect&#243;nico, es decir, viven nadando entre dos aguas en vez de en el fondo. Otro rasgo com&#250;n, compartido con algunos otros dec&#225;podos, es que el primer par de patas locomotoras se ha convertido evolutivamente en un par de pinzas, que emplean para la captura y manipulaci&#243;n del alimento, para el cortejo, o para la disputa territorial.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Existen m&#225;s de 4.000 especies de animales que son o pueden ser llamados cangrejos. La mayor&#237;a viven cerca o dentro del agua, aunque algunos solo van al agua para reproducirse. Los cangrejos no suelen ser grandes nadadores, sino que se desplazan por el fondo sobre sus patas, y en muchos casos son capaces de transitar fuera del agua e incluso de trepar por las palmeras.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Como artr&#243;podos que son, los cangrejos est&#225;n dotados de un exoesqueleto cuyo componente principal es la quitina, el cual en su caso adquiere a menudo el car&#225;cter de un verdadero caparaz&#243;n, porque suele estar mineralizado con carbonato c&#225;lcico. Como para el resto de los artr&#243;podos, el crecimiento requiere de una muda del exoesqueleto, ocasi&#243;n que muchas especies aprovechan para la reproducci&#243;n.</Spanish>

		<English>The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold. At times, surrounded by enemies, they rose to the challenge and so developed the most powerful military power in the known world. They consciously put their legendary barbaric hardness into helping subdue the enemy and keep the danger of vassal uprisings low. The Assyrians were a very warlike people.They were really masters of the art of war.They were very clever in how they first went about besieging the enemys main cities. They would divert rivers so that the enemy ran out of water. Or they brought down walls with large battering rams.There were also archers in their troops who targeted the enemy from high platforms .In order to put other cities in the same fear and terror, they were particularly cruel to their enemies. The Assyrians were spared destruction during the environmental catastrophe and the following seafarers migration period in the year 1200 B.C., perhaps because they already used newer military tactics and weapons which earlier kingdoms still didnt have. The first Assyrian armies were composed of peasants with spears. After several military reforms around 800 BC the Assyrians still maintained a solid army, which consisted of draftees and professional soldiers. This army was better equipped and armed than most enemies, which brought many benefits. The armies of the Neo-Assyrian Empire benefited from the fact that the iron they crafted into improved swords and armor was cheap.The Assyrians were among the first to pursue the concept of an integrated army.This consisted of an infantry core for the blitz attack, accompanied by troops with light missiles and a mobile flank, consisting of chariots, cavalry and camel riders.

		<German>Die Assyrer fielen ein wie der Wolf &#252;ber die Herde. Zeitweilig umgeben von Feinden, wuchsen Sie an der Herausforderung und entwickelten sich so zur m&#228;chtigsten Milit&#228;rmacht der damals bekannten Welt. Sie setzten ihre legend&#228;re barbarische H&#228;rte bewu&#223;t dazu ein, die Feinde zu unterwerfen und die Gefahr von Vasallenaufst&#228;nden gering zu halten. Die Assyrer waren ein besonders kriegerisches Volk. Sie waren geradezu Meister der Kriegskunst. Dabei gingen sie sehr geschickt vor, indem sie die wichtigsten St&#228;dte der Feinde zun&#228;chst belagerten. Es kam vor, dass sie Fl&#252;sse umleiteten, damit den Feinden das Wasser ausging. Oder sie zerst&#246;rten Mauern mit gro&#223;en Rammb&#246;cken. Au&#223;erdem gab es Bogensch&#252;tzen in ihren Truppen, die von hohen Plattformen auf die Feinde zielten. Damit andere St&#228;dte gleich in Angst und Schrecken versetzt wurden, gingen sie besonders grausam mit ihren Feinden um. Die Assyrer blieben w&#228;hrend der Umweltkatastrophe und der folgenden Seev&#246;lkerwanderung im Jahre 1200 v. Chr. von Zerst&#246;rung verschont, vielleicht weil sie sich bereits neuer milit&#228;rischer Taktiken und Waffen bedienten, die &#228;ltere K&#246;nigreiche noch nicht hatten. Die ersten assyrischen Armeen bestanden aus Bauern mit Speeren. Nach mehreren milit&#228;rischen Reformen um 800 v. Chr. Unterhielten die Assyrer jedoch eine feste Armee, die aus Einberufenen und Berufssoldaten bestand. Diese Armee war besser ausger&#252;stet und bewaffnet als die meisten Feinde, was viele Vorteile brachte. Die Armeen des Neuassyrischen Reiches profitierten davon, dass Eisen billig war, das sie zu verbesserten Schwertern und R&#252;stungen verarbeiteten. Die Assyrer geh&#246;rten zu den Ersten, die das Konzept der ganzheitlichen Armee verfolgten. Diese bestand aus einem Infanterie-Kern f&#252;r den Blitzangriff, begleitet von Truppen mit leichten Wurfgeschossen und einer mobilen Flanke, bestehend aus Streitwagen, Kamelreitern und Kavallerie. Die Armee konnte sowohl in der Ebene k&#228;mpfen, wo Streitwagen und Kavallerie entscheidend waren als auch in schwierigem Gel&#228;nde, wo Pferde und Streitwagen kaum von Nutzen waren. Sie f&#252;hrten im Norden und Osten regelm&#228;&#223;ig Feldz&#252;ge gegen Barbaren, die eine st&#228;ndige Bedrohung darstellten. Viele Jahre lang waren die Streitwagenk&#228;mpfer die Elite der Armee, bis sie nach Abschaffung der Streitwagen von der Kavallerie abgel&#246;st wurden. Die Assyrer beherrschten es meisterhaft, durch W&#228;lle gesch&#252;tzte St&#228;dte einzunehmen. Die geschichtlichen Aufzeichnungen berichten von zahlreichen Angriffen auf St&#228;dte und von der Brutalit&#228;t der Assyrer. Oftmals zerst&#246;rten sie ganze St&#228;dte, wenn diese sich nicht ergaben. Die B&#252;rger wurden entweder get&#246;tet oder als Sklaven an das andere Ende des Reiches verschleppt.</German>

		<English>Hunting is the practice of pursuing any living thing, but usually wildlife for food, recreation, or trade. In present-day use, the term refers to lawful hunting, as distinguished from poaching, which is the killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species contrary to applicable law. The species which are hunted are referred to as game, and are usually mammals and migratory or non-migratory gamebirds. Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply. The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included protein, bone for implements, sinew for cordage, fur, feathers, rawhide and leather used in clothing. Mans earliest hunting weapons would have included rocks, spears, the atlatl, and bow and arrows. Hunting is still vital in marginal climates, especially those unsuited for pastoral uses or agriculture. For example, Inuit people in the Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing, and use the skins of sea mammals to make kayaks, clothing, and footwear. On ancient reliefs, especially from Mesopotamia, kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions, and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot. The cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos, and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity, the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana. Taboos are often related to hunting, and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple. Euripides tale of Artemis and Actaeon, for example, may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey, or impudent boasting.</English>

		<English>An archive is a collection of historical records, or the physical place they are located. Archives contain primary source documents that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organizations lifetime, and are kept to show the function of an organization. In general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines for which many identical copies exist. This means that archives (the places) are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings. The word originally developed from the Greek arkheion which refers to the home or dwelling of the Archon, in which important official state documents were filed and interpreted under the authority of the Archon. The adjective formed from archive is archival. Archives in colleges, universities, and other educational facilities are typically housed within a library, and duties may be carried out by an archivist or a librarian. Occasionally, history professors may also run a smaller archive. Academic archives exist to preserve and celebrate the history of their school and academic community. An academic archive may contain items such as papers of former professors and presidents, memorabilia related to school organizations and activities, and items the academic library wishes to remain in a closed-stack setting, such as rare books or thesis copies. Access to the majority of these archives is by appointment only. Users of academic archives are often graduate students and those wishing to view rare or historical documents for research purposes.</English>

		<German>Der Beruf des Schreibers wurde in &#196;gypten erstmals ab 2700 v. Chr. erw&#228;hnt. In einem Beamtengrab aus der Zeit des Pharaos Sechemib fand man Siegel, die den Beruf erw&#228;hnten. Der Schreiber wurde mit den wachsenden Anforderungen der Gesellschaft immer mehr zum Beamten. Die Schreiber hatten auch das Kopieren von Texten als Aufgabe. Vorher hatte man die Texte aus dem Ged&#228;chtnis heraus geschrieben. Die Schreiber dieser Texte signierten ihre Kopien und garantierten damit die genaue Abschrift des Textes. Die Erkenntnisse aus der Medizin, Mathematik und anderer Wissenschaften fanden jetzt einen gro&#223;en Leserkreis. Die komplizierte Schrift verlangte dabei eine langj&#228;hrige, teure Ausbildung. Das hohe Prestige des Amtes sorgte daf&#252;r, dass h&#228;ufig die S&#246;hne von Schreibern die Ausbildung begannen. Die Schreiber waren aber nicht nur als Beamte t&#228;tig, einige waren auch als Autoren von viel gelesenen B&#252;chern bekannt. Erhalten haben sich die Weisheitslehren von Ani und Amenemope aus dem Neuen Reich. W&#228;hrend die Tempel in ihren Bibliotheken das Wissen der Zeit bewahrten, gab es auch Bibliotheken von gebildeten, wohlhabenden B&#252;rgern und Gelehrten. Im Laufe der Ramessidenzeit ver&#228;nderte sich die geschriebene Schrift. In der Verwaltung entwickelte man eine "Schnellschrift mit zahlreichen neugeschaffenen K&#252;rzeln. F&#252;r literarische Manuskripte verwendeten die Schreiber eine kunstvolle, aber deutlichere Buchschrift, die leichter zu lesen war.

		<English>The importance of elephants in ancient times was of violent reason. Among the ancient peoples of its history is closely linked with the history of warfare. So the Indian king of the Prasies possessed 9000 war elephants, which he cultivated as the other owner of the tanks of ancient times, not to breed in stables, but wild caught and tamed it. The Persian kings, with which Alexander had to fight, had war elephants; but it was Darius III. who first put 15 elephants as a vanguard of his army. Alexander took acquaintance with them in the Battle of Gaugamela 331, but did not get so much surprised by them-which proved his class as a general-and still beat the enemy and captured the elephants. From the first Indian king, whom he met later at the passage of the Indus river, Alexander received 30 elephants as a gift. In the battle of the Hydaspes he captured about 300 of the valuable animals, so that he could now build even this type of weapon. Unfortunately, his successors lost them again in famines and had to deliver later acquired animals as war booty in unfortunate battles against the Romans. Another known leader was Attila of the Huns who was carrying 2000 elephants in his huge army of horsemen. The Ptolemies of Egypt also had war elephants, which they captured on extended hunts on the east coast of Africa in Eritrea and Somalia. For this purpose, a separate town called "Hunting-Ptolemais" was founded, the base for a whole elephant hunting Army Corps.</English>

		<German>Die Bedeutung des Elefanten im Altertum lag auf kriegerischem Gebiet. Bei den alten V&#246;lkern ist seine Geschichte mit der Geschichte der Kriegskunst eng verkn&#252;pft. So besa&#223; der indische K&#246;nig der Prasier 9000 Kriegselefanten, die er, wie auch die anderen Besitzer dieser Panzerwagen des Altertums, nicht in Gest&#252;ten z&#252;chtete, sondern wild fing und dann z&#228;hmte. Auch die Perserk&#246;nige, mit denen es Alexander zu tun hatte, besa&#223;en Kriegselefanten; aber erst Darius III. setzte 15 Elefanten als Vorhut seines Heeres ein. Alexander machte mit ihnen 331 in der Schlacht von Gaugamela Bekanntschaft, lie&#223; sich jedoch von ihnen nicht weiter &#252;berraschen-was seine Klasse als Feldherr bewies -, sondern schlug trotzdem seine Feinde und erbeutete die Elefanten. Vom ersten indischen K&#246;nig, den er sp&#228;ter beim &#220;bergang &#252;ber den Indus traf, erhielt Alexander 30 Elefanten zum Geschenk. In der Schlacht am Hydaspes erbeutete er etwa 300 der wertvollen Tiere, so Dass er nun selbst diese Waffengattung aufbauen konnte. Seine Nachfolger verloren sie aber wieder bei Hungersn&#246;ten und mussten andere, sp&#228;ter erworbene Tiere in ihren ungl&#252;cklichen K&#228;mpfen gegen die R&#246;mer als Kriegsbeute ausliefern. Von anderen V&#246;lkern sind namentlich die Hunnen Attilas bekannt, die 2000 Elefanten in ihren riesigen Reiterheeren mitf&#252;hrten. Auch die &#228;gyptischen Ptolem&#228;er besa&#223;en Kriegselefanten, die sie auf ausgedehnten Jagden an der Ostk&#252;ste Afrikas bei Eritrea und Somalia erbeuteten. Zu diesem Zweck wurde eine eigene Stadt namens "Jagdptolemais" gegr&#252;ndet, der St&#252;tzpunkt f&#252;r ein ganzes Elefantenj&#228;ger-Armeekorps.</German>

		<Spanish>La entrada de los elefantes de guerra en contacto con el mundo occidental se dio a orillas del R&#237;o Hydaspes, en la India, de una forma dram&#225;tica, cuando el ej&#233;rcito de Alejandro Magno choc&#243; con las tropas del rey Poros el a&#241;o 326 a.C. En esta gran batalla el estratega macedonio se enfrent&#243; a m&#225;s de cien elefantes acorazados que en varias ocasiones consiguieron abrir huecos en la falange. Admirado por el uso que se le pod&#237;a dar a estos animales dentro de su ej&#233;rcito, a los ejemplares capturados en la batalla sum&#243; otros muchos regalo de los pr&#237;ncipes del Indo, lo que le permiti&#243; llegar a contar en el momento de su muerte con m&#225;s de 200 paquidermos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Durante las guerras que siguieron a la muerte del gran Alejandro, algunos de sus generales nutrieron sus ej&#233;rcitos de elefantes, pues se pensaba que por su peso y poder se convertir&#237;an en el arma decisiva de las batallas. De hecho, el rey Sele&#250;co, lleg&#243; a contar con m&#225;s de medio millar de elefantes en su poderoso y moderno ej&#233;rcito, probablemente entonces, el m&#225;s fuerte del mundo. Los sel&#233;ucidas no fueron los &#250;nicos reyes helen&#237;sticos que dotaron a sus ej&#233;rcitos de elefantes y tanto macedonios como egipcios o epirotas, fueron entrenando a conductores y tropas especiales para combatir a lomos de elefantes. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Durante estos a&#241;os, finales del siglo IV a.C y principios del III, los reyes griegos de Oriente dise&#241;aron t&#225;cticas cada vez m&#225;s sofisticadas que permitiesen un empleo eficaz de los elefantes de guerra en las ordenadas batalla de los ej&#233;rcitos helen&#237;sticos. Los sele&#250;cidas, por ejemplo, desplegaban filas compactas de elefantes con armaduras y protecciones en bloques cerrados que lanzaban contra las filas enemigas hasta destruirlas, siendo apoyados en los flancos por infanter&#237;a ligera armada con arcos y hondas. Cada escuadra estaba formada por un elefante, su conductor, dos tripulantes y cuarenta solados de apoyo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Durante las primeras d&#233;cadas del siglo III a.C., se pens&#243; que el elefante era un arma no s&#243;lo necesaria, sino decisiva en la guerra moderna, por lo que otros ej&#233;rcitos no hel&#233;nicos de la Oikumene, pero influidos por la poderosa cultura griega, incorporan poco a poco elefantes a sus ej&#233;rcitos. Uno de estos estados fue Cartago, que adem&#225;s, influyo poderosamente en el empleo t&#225;ctico de estas poderosas bestias.</Spanish>

		<German>Das Wort kommt aus dem Griechischen "hairesis" und bedeutet urspr&#252;nglich "Das Nehmen" "Die Wahl", in kirchengeschichtlichem Kontext bedeutet es "Selbsterw&#228;hlte Anschauung". In der fr&#252;hen Kirchengeschichte wurden "Abweichler" vom fr&#252;hkatholischen Glaubensbekenntnis als "H&#228;retiker" bezeichnet. Der Begriff wurde wahrscheinlich zum ersten Mal vom Kirchenvater Ignatius von Antiochia (um 110 nach Christus) gebraucht. Die H&#228;resien sind nicht an einer bestimmten Religion gebunden, sondern betreffen alle Religionen (polytheistische Glaubensrichtungen und vor allem Christentum, Judentum und Islam) und deren Verfolgung Andersgl&#228;ubiger oder Atheisten. Im heutigen Sprachgebrauch wird "H&#228;resie" synonym f&#252;r "ketzerisch", "abweichlerisch" und "verdammenswert" gebraucht. Viele bedeutende Wissenschaftler wurden Opfer der H&#228;resie. Sokrates wurde schon 399 v. Chr. in Athen nach einem &#246;ffentlichen Prozess wegen Atheismus hingerichtet. Die Inhalte der Gro&#223;en Bibliothek von Alexandria wurde stark dezimiert, es im Jahre 391 von Christen teilweise zerst&#246;rt wurde. Als Alexandria 642 durch den Kalifen Umar ibn al-Chattab f&#252;r den Islam erobert wurde, soll er der &#220;berlieferung zufolge befohlen habe, alle noch vorhandenen B&#252;cher zu vernichten, die dem Koran widersprachen. Hypatia, die Tochter eines Mathematikprofessors an der Universit&#228;t von Alexandria, war ber&#252;hmt daf&#252;r, die beliebtesten Vorlesungen in der bekannten Welt zu halten, und galt als die gr&#246;&#223;te Probleml&#246;serin.

Chr. von einer christlichen Horde wilder und gnadenloser Fanatiker niedergemetzelt (man kratzte ihr mit scharfen Austernschalen das Fleisch von den Knochen und &#252;bergab ihre zitternden Gliedma&#223;en den Flammen). F&#252;r Alexandria, das kulturelle und geistige Zentrum der Antike, bedeutet Hypatias Tod das Ende einer &#196;ra. Nach der Zerst&#246;rung der Bibliothek, der Schlie&#223;ung und Verw&#252;stung vieler ihrer Lehrst&#228;tten und Tempel, stirbt nun mit der Leiterin des Museion auch ihre ber&#252;hmteste Repr&#228;sentantin der freien Wissenschaft.

		<English>Marduk was the Babylonian name of a late-generation god from ancient Mesopotamia and patron deity of the city of Babylon, who, when Babylon became the political center of the Euphrates valley in the time of Hammurabi (18th century BCE), started to slowly rise to the position of the head of the Babylonian pantheon, a position he fully acquired by the second half of the second millennium BCE. In the perfected system of astrology, the planet Jupiter was associated with Marduk by the Hammurabi period. Marduks original character is obscure but he was later on connected with water, vegetation, judgment, and magic. He was also regarded as the son of Ea(Sumerian Enki) and Damkina and the heir of Anu but whatever special traits Marduk may have had were overshadowed by the political development through which the Euphrates valley passed and which led to imbuing him with traits belonging to gods who in an earlier period were recognized as the heads of the pantheon. There are particularly two godsEa and Enlilwhose powers and attributes pass over to Marduk. In the case of Ea, the transfer proceeded pacifically and without effacing the older god. Marduk took over the identity of Asarluhi, the son of Ea and god of magic, so that Marduk was integrated in the pantheon of Eridu where both Ea and Asarluhi originally came from. Father Ea voluntarily recognized the superiority of the son and hands over to him the control of humanity. This association of Marduk and Ea, while indicating primarily the passing of the supremacy once enjoyed by Eridu to Babylon as a religious and political centre, may also reflect an early dependence of Babylon upon Eridu, not necessarily of a political character but, in view of the spread of culture in the Euphrates valley from the south to the north, the recognition of Eridu as the older centre on the part of the younger one. While the relationship between Ea and Marduk is marked by harmony and an amicable abdication on the part of the father in favour of his son, Marduks absorption of the power and prerogatives of Enlil of Nippur was at the expense of the latters prestige. After the days of Hammurabi, the cult of Marduk eclipsed that of Enlil; although Nippur and the cult of Enlil enjoyed a period of renaissance during the four centuries of Kassite control in Babylonia (c. 1570 BCE1157 BCE), the definite and permanent triumph of Marduk over Enlil became felt within the Babylonian empire. The only serious rival to Marduk after ca. 1000 BCE was Aur in Assyria. In the south, Marduk reigned supreme. He is normally referred to as Bel "Lord", also bel rabim "great lord", bel belim "lord of lords", ab-kal ilani bel tereti "leader of the gods", aklu bel terieti "the wise, lord of oracles", muballit mite "reviver of the dead", etc. When Babylon became the capital of Mesopotamia, the patron deity of Babylon was elevated to the level of supreme god. In order to explain how Marduk seized power, Enuma Elish was written, which tells the story of Marduks birth, heroic deeds and becoming the ruler of the gods. This can be viewed as a form of Mesopotamian apologetics. Also included in this document are the fifty names of Marduk. In Enuma Elish, a civil war between the gods was growing to a climactic battle. The Anunnaki gods gathered together to find one god who could defeat the gods rising against them. Marduk, a very young god, answered the call and was promised the position of head god. To prepare for battle, he makes a bow, fletches arrows, grabs a mace, throws lightning before him, fills his body with flame, makes a net to encircle Tiamat within it, gathers the four winds so that no part of her could escape, creates seven nasty new winds such as the whirlwind and tornado, and raises up his mightiest weapon, the rain-flood. Then he sets out for battle, mounting his storm-chariot drawn by four horses with poison in their mouths. In his lips he holds a spell and in one hand he grasps a herb to counter poison. First, he challenges the leader of the Anunnaki gods, the dragon of the primordial sea Tiamat, to single combat and defeats her by trapping her with his net, blowing her up with his winds, and piercing her belly with an arrow. Then, he proceeds to defeat Kingu, who Tiamat put in charge of the army and wore the Tablets of Destiny on his breast, and "wrested from him the Tablets of Destiny, wrongfully his" and assumed his new position. Under his reign humans were created to bear the burdens of life so the gods could be at leisure. Marduk was depicted as a human, often with his symbol the snake-dragon which he had taken over from the god Tishpak. Another symbol that stood for Marduk was the spade. Babylonian texts talk of the creation of Eridu by the god Marduk as the first city, "the holy city, the dwelling of their [the other gods] delight".

		<German>Marduk (Jungrind des Utu) war ein Gott der babylonischen Religion. Er war im 3. Jahrtausend v. Chr. in Mesopotamien noch unbekannt und stieg als eingewanderter Gott &#252;ber den Rang eines unbedeutenden Stadtgottes zur Hauptgottheit der babylonischen Religion und Oberhaupt des babylonischen Pantheons auf. Er tr&#228;gt u.a. den Titel "Herr der vier Weltgegenden", der aus dem Sumerischen &#252;bernommen wurde. Seit dem Aufstieg der Stadt Babylon im babylonischen Reich wurde die Religion der Stadt mit ihrem Gott Marduk immer wichtiger. Marduk, welcher in Wahrheit ein m&#228;chtiger und alter D&#228;mon ist, h&#228;lt Kontakt mit seinen Anh&#228;ngern in Form der Marduk-Priesterschaft, einer hierarchisch organisierten Organisation, die aus Priestern, Novizen und niederen D&#228;monen besteht. Die Marduk-Priesterschaft stellt im neubabylonischen Reich eine m&#228;chtige Organisation dar, welche eng mit dem K&#246;nig von Babylon zusammenarbeitet und den Willen von Marduk vollstreckt. Die Priester sind zudem in der Lage, Rituale und kleinere Zauberspr&#252;che auszu&#252;ben und versuchen stets, Marduk-Ungl&#228;ubige zu bekehren. Die Machenschaften der Mardukpriester gehen bis zum K&#246;nigsmord. So wurde der junge Labaschi-Marduk Nachfolger K&#246;nig Nergilissars von der rivalisierenden Priesterschaft nach neun Monaten beseitigt. Ein weiterer wichtiger Wendepunkt in der Geschichte war die Rebellion Babylons gegen ihren Eroberer Xerxes. F&#252;r die Mardukpriesterschaft gab es ein eigenes Ritual f&#252;r den Herrscher Babylons. Doch Xerxes wollte sich nicht in einer eigenen Zeremonie zum Stadtk&#246;nig ernennen, da der Titel als persischen Gottk&#246;nigs f&#252;r Babylon ausreichen musste. Die Priesterschaft stellte sich gegen Xerxes Einfluss, worauf er den Turm zu Babel und die Marduk-Statue zerst&#246;ren lie&#223;. Dieser Fehler veranlasste Babylon sich gegen das persische Reich aufzulehnen. Diese Revolte zwang Xerxes, der bereits Athen erfolgreich erobern konnte, den Krieg gegen Griechenland zu beenden und in sein Land zur&#252;ckzukehren. Ein Schicksalsschlag der die Unterwerfung Griechenlands an die Perser verhinderte!</German>

Under his reign humans were created to bear the burdens of life so the gods could be at leisure. Marduk was depicted as a human, often with his symbol the snake-dragon which he had taken over from the god Tishpak. Another symbol that stood for Marduk was the spade. Babylonian texts talk of the creation of Eridu by the god Marduk as the first city, "the holy city, the dwelling of their [the other gods] delight". Nabu, god of wisdom, is a son of Marduk.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Marduk fue el nombre de un dios de la &#250;ltima generaci&#243;n de Mesopotamia y la deidad patrona de la ciudad de Babilonia. Cuando esta ciudad se convirti&#243; en el centro pol&#237;tico de los estados unificados del Valle de &#201;ufrates en los tiempos de Hammurabi (siglo XVII a. C.), se levant&#243; como cabeza del pante&#243;n de dioses Babil&#243;nico.Existen particularmente dos dioses -Ea y Enlil-cuyos poderes y atributos fueron heredados por Marduk. En el caso de Ea la transferencia procedi&#243; pac&#237;ficamente y sin opacar al dios m&#225;s viejo, por lo tanto, Marduk es visto como un hijo de Ea. El padre reconoce voluntariamente la superioridad del hijo y le entrega el control de la humanidad. Esta asociaci&#243;n de Marduk y Ea, aunque indica la supremac&#237;a una vez gozada por Eridu como centro pol&#237;tico y religioso de Babilonia, tambi&#233;n puede reflejar una temprana dependencia de Babilonia sobre Eridu, no necesariamente de car&#225;cter pol&#237;tico, sino, en vista de la difusi&#243;n de la cultura en el Valle de &#201;ufrates desde el sur hacia el norte, el reconocimiento de Eridu como el centro m&#225;s antiguo por parte del m&#225;s joven.En todos los acontecimientos, los rastros de un culto de Marduk en Eridu deben ser observados en la literatura religiosa, y la explicaci&#243;n m&#225;s razonable para la existencia del dios Marduk en Eridu es asumir que Babilonia pag&#243; de esta manera su homenaje hacia la vieja ciudad como cabeza del Golfo P&#233;rsico.Mientras que la relaci&#243;n entre Ea y Marduk esta marcada por la armon&#237;a y una amistosa abdicaci&#243;n por parte del padre en favor del hijo, la asimilaci&#243;n de poder de Marduk y las prerrogativas de poder de Enlil de Nippur fueron a expensas del prestigio de este &#250;ltimo. Despu&#233;s de la &#233;poca de Hammurabi, el culto de Marduk eclips&#243; al de Enlil, y aunque durante los cuatro siglos de control de los casitas sobre Babilonia (1570 a. C.-1157 a. C.), Nippur y el culto de Enlil disfrutaron un periodo de renacimiento, pero cuando sobrevino la reacci&#243;n, se marc&#243; el triunfo definitivo y permanente de Marduk sobre Enlil hasta el fin del Imperio Babil&#243;nico. El &#250;nico rival serio de Marduk despu&#233;s del a&#241;o 1000 a. C. fue Assur en Asiria. En el sur de los reinos supremos de Marduk. El normalmente es referido como Belio "Se&#241;or".Cuando Babilonia se convirti&#243; en la capital de la Mesopotamia, la deidad patrona de Babilonia fue elevada a nivel de dios supremo. Para explicar como Marduk lleg&#243; al poder, se escribi&#243; el En&#251;ma Elish, que cuenta la historia del nacimiento de Marduk, sus gestas heroicas, y como lleg&#243; a convertirse en el se&#241;or de los dioses. Esto puede verse como una forma de apolog&#237;as Mesopot&#225;micas. En el En&#251;ma Elish, creci&#243; una guerra civil entre los dioses hasta convertirse en una batalla clim&#225;tica. Los dioses Anunnaki se reunieron para encontrar un dios que pudiese derrotar a los dioses que se levantaron en su contra. Marduk, un dios joven, contest&#243; a este llamado, y se le prometi&#243; la posici&#243;n de dios Supremo. Cuando &#233;l mat&#243; a su enemigo le arrebat&#243; las "Tablillas del Destino", que pose&#237;a il&#237;citamente y asumi&#243; su nueva posici&#243;n. Bajo su reinado, se cre&#243; a la raza humana para llevar las cargas de la vida, de manera que los dioses pudiesen disfrutar del ocio. Varios personajes fueron nombrados en honor a Marduk. Por ejemplo, la personalidad b&#237;blica de Mordechai (Libro de Ester) us&#243; su nombre Gentil en reemplazo a su nombre Hebreo, Bilshan. Nabu, dios de la sabidur&#237;a, es un hijo de Marduk.</Spanish>

		<English>The Latin word castrum (plural castra) was used by the ancient Romans to mean buildings or plots of land reserved to or constructed for use as a military defensive position. As the word appears in both Oscan and Umbrian (dialects of Italic) as well as in Latin, it probably descended from Indo-European to Italic. In classical Latin the word castra always means "great legionary encampment", both "marching", "temporary" ones and the "fortified permanent" ones, while the diminutive form castellum was used for the smaller forts, which were usually, but not always, occupied by the auxiliary units and used as logistic bases for the legions, as explained by Vegetius. A generic term is praesidium ("guard post or garrison"). The terms stratopedon ("army camp") and phrourion ("fort") were used by Greek language authors, in order to designate the Roman castra and the Roman castellum respectively. In English, the terms "Roman fortress", "Roman fort" and "Roman camp" are commonly used for the castra. However the scholars convention always requires the use of the word "camp", "marching camp" and "fortress" as a translation of castra and the use of the word "fort" as a translation of castellum and this type of convention is usually followed and found in all the scholarly works. The best known type of castra is the camp, a military town designed to house and protect the soldiers and their equipment and supplies when they were not fighting or marching. Regulations required a major unit in the field to retire to a properly constructed camp every day. "...as soon as they have marched into an enemys land, they do not begin to fight till they have walled their camp about; nor is the fence they raise rashly made, or uneven; nor do they all abide ill it, nor do those that are in it take their places at random; but if it happens that the ground is uneven, it is first leveled: their camp is also four-square by measure, and carpenters are ready, in great numbers, with their tools, to erect their buildings for them." To this end a marching column ported the equipment needed to build and stock the camp in a baggage train of wagons and on the backs of the soldiers. Camps were the responsibility of engineering units to which specialists of many types belonged, officered by architecti, "chief engineers", who requisitioned manual labor from the soldiers at large as required. They could throw up a camp under enemy attack in as little as a few hours. Judging from the names, they probably used a repertory of camp plans, selecting the one appropriate to the length of time a legion would spend in it: tertia castra, quarta castra, etc., "a camp of three days", "four days", etc. More permanent camps were castra stativa, "standing camps". The least permanent of these were castra aestiva or aestivalia, "summer camps", in which the soldiers were housed sub pellibus or sub tentoriis, "under tents". Summer was the campaign season. For the winter the soldiers retired to castra hiberna containing barracks of more solid materials, public buildings and stone walls. The camp allowed the Romans to keep a rested and supplied army in the field. Neither the Celtic nor Germanic armies had this capability: they found it necessary to disperse after only a few days; meanwhile, their open camps invited attack when they were least prepared.</English>

		<German>Das R&#246;mische Milit&#228;rlager (dt. Kastell, Latein: castrum, plural castra) war ein wesentliches Element des r&#246;mischen Heerwesens. Zus&#228;tzlich zu seiner Funktion als Ausgangspunkt f&#252;r milit&#228;rische Operationen oder als kurzfristiger Standort vor Schlachten hatten insbesondere die st&#228;ndigen Garnisonen aufgrund ihrer Wirtschaftskraft wesentlichen Anteil an der Romanisierung der eroberten Gebiete. Zahlreiche St&#228;dtegr&#252;ndungen gehen auf urspr&#252;nglich milit&#228;rische Standorte der R&#246;mer zur&#252;ck. Der Ursprung der sp&#228;teren festen Kastellbauten war das Feldlager der r&#246;mischen Republik. Die st&#228;ndigen r&#246;mischen Kastelle der Kaiserzeit wurden dann bis in das 3. Jahrhundert n. Chr. nach einem offensichtlich stark vereinheitlichten Grundschema angelegt. Sie folgten in ihrer Anlage dem Prinzip der &#228;lteren Marschlager. Die sehr h&#228;ufig rechteckige Lagerumwehrung besa&#223; zumeist abgerundete Ecken, in denen Wacht&#252;rme standen. Nach allen vier Himmelsrichtungen &#246;ffnete sich meist je ein Tor, durch das die vier Lagerhauptstra&#223;en rechtwinkelig traten und im Mittelpunkt des Kastells zusammenliefen. Die wichtigste Ausfallstra&#223;e war die Via praetoria, welche zum Haupttor (Porta praetoria) hinausf&#252;hrte. Dort befand sich auch die Pr&#228;torialfront, die dem Feind zugewandte Lagerseite. Zu den beiden Schmalseiten f&#252;hrte die Via principalis dextra und die Via principalis sinistra an deren Endpunkt die Porta principalis dextra (das rechte Tor) und die Porta principalis sinistra (das linke Tor) lag. R&#252;ckw&#228;rtig befand sich die Via decumana, die mit der Porta decumana korrespondierte. Am Kreuzungspunkt der beiden Hauptstra&#223;en, genannt Locus gromae, nach dem Vermessungsinstrument Groma, mit dem das Lager von hier aus vermessen wurde, lagen die Principia, das Stabsgeb&#228;ude. Meist links oder rechts des Stabsgeb&#228;udes befand sich das Praetorium, das Wohnhaus des Kommandeurs sowie der Getreidespeicher (Horreum). Der Bereich zwischen der Via principalis und der Porta praetoria wurde Praetentura (Vorderlager) genannt, der Bereich zwischen der R&#252;ckseite des Stabsgeb&#228;udes und der Porta decumana hie&#223; Retentura (Hinterlager). Eine weitere wichtige Stra&#223;e befindet sich im Intervallum, dem Raum zwischen Wehrmauer und Wall und der angrenzenden Innenbebauung des Kastells. Dort f&#252;hrt die Lagerringstra&#223;e, Via sagularis rund um alle Baulichkeiten der Anlage. Innerhalb der Befestigung konnte es verschiedenste Einrichtungen geben, die sich nach den jeweiligen Erfordernissen richteten.</German>

		<Spanish>En el Imperio romano, un castrum (en plural castra, una fortaleza) era un campo militar romano. Originalmente, un castrum es una fortificaci&#243;n celta que semeja un castillo rodeado de una muralla circular en la cima de una colina. Los romanos usaron luego el t&#233;rmino para designar sus campos militares, que eran rectangulares. Los campos romanos siempre fueron edificados conforme a un cierto modelo, con dos pasos principales que se cruzaban: el "Cardo Maximus", que se extend&#237;a al norte y al sur, y el "Decumanus Maximus" al este y al oeste, lo que divid&#237;a el campo en cuatro partes iguales. Las avenidas acababan en cuatro portales. El forum se ubicaba en la intersecci&#243;n del Cardo Maximus y el Decumanus Maximus. El resto de las calles y construcciones se hallaban paralelas a las principales, las cuales formaban un patr&#243;n de cuadr&#237;cula que se utiliza mucho en las ciudades. Varios poblados en Europa surgieron a partir de campos militares romanos y hasta el d&#237;a de hoy muestran rasgos de sus modelos originales (por ejemplo Castres en Francia, Barcelona en Espa&#241;a). El Castrum fue la base del modelo empleado por los colonos espa&#241;oles en Am&#233;rica, el "tablero" de 7 manzanas de 100m por lado con una Plaza de Armas en el centro cerca de un r&#237;o y de una colina defendible, siguiendo estrictas normas impuestas por la monarqu&#237;a espa&#241;ola para la fundaci&#243;n de nuevas ciudades en el Nuevo Mundo. Muchos pueblos de Inglaterra a&#250;n mantienen derivados de la palabra castra en sus nombres, como Lancaster, Chester, Leicester y M&#225;nchester, por ejemplo.</Spanish>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIVIC_DEMOCRACY_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Democracy is a form of government in which all citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Ideally, this includes equal (and more or less direct) participation in the proposal, development and passage of legislation into law. It can also encompass social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. The term comes from the Greek: demokratia "rule of the people",which was coined from Demos "people" and Kratos "power", in the middle of the 5th-4th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens following a popular uprising in 508 BC. According to some theories of democracy, popular sovereignty is the founding principle of such a system. However, the democratic principle has also been expressed as "the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known." This type of freedom, which is connected to human "natality," or the capacity to begin anew, sees democracy as "not only a political system [but] an ideal, an aspiration, really, intimately connected to and dependent upon a picture of what it is to be humanof what it is a human should be to be fully human." While there is no specific, universally accepted definition of democracy, equality and freedom have both been identified as important characteristics of democracy since ancient times, These principles are reflected in all citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative, and the freedom of its citizens is secured by legitimized rights and liberties which are generally protected by a constitution. There are several varieties of democracy, some of which provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others. However, if any democracy is not structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its own favor, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy. Representative Democracy, Consensus Democracy, and Deliberative Democracy are all major examples of attempts at a form of government that is both practical and responsive to the needs and desires of citizens. Many people use the term "democracy" as shorthand for liberal democracy, which may include elements such as political pluralism; equality before the law; the right to petition elected officials for redress of grievances; due process; civil liberties; human rights; and elements of civil society outside the government. In the United States, separation of powers is often cited as a central attribute, but in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty (though in practice judicial independence is generally maintained). In other cases, "democracy" is used to mean direct democracy. Though the term "democracy" is typically used in the context of a political state, the principles are applicable to private organizations and other groups as well. Majority rule is often listed as a characteristic of democracy. However, it is also possible for a minority to be oppressed by a "tyranny of the majority" in the absence of governmental or constitutional protections of individual and/or group rights. An essential part of an "ideal" representative democracy is competitive elections that are fair both substantively and procedurally. Furthermore, freedom of political expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press are considered to be essential, so that citizens are adequately informed and able to vote according to their own best interests as they see them. It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of individuals to participate freely and fully in the life of their society. Democracy has its formal origins in Ancient Greece, but democratic practices are evident in earlier societies including Mesopotamia, Phoenicia and India. Other cultures since Greece have significantly contributed to the evolution of democracy such as Ancient Rome, Europe, and North and South America. The concept of representative democracy arose largely from ideas and institutions that developed during the European Middle Ages and the Age of Enlightenment and in the American and French Revolutions. Democracy has been called the "last form of government" and has spread considerably across the globe. The right to vote has been expanded in many jurisdictions over time from relatively narrow groups (such as wealthy men of a particular ethnic group), with New Zealand the first nation to grant universal suffrage for all its citizens in 1893. The term democracy first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in Athens during the late 6th century BCE. The philosopher Plato contrasted democracy, the system of "rule by the governed", with the alternative systems of monarchy (rule by one individual), oligarchy (rule by a small lite class) and timocracy (ruling class of property owners). Today Classical Athenian democracy is considered by many to have been a direct democracy. Originally it had two distinguishing features: first the allotment (selection by lot) of ordinary citizens to the few government offices and the courts, and secondarily the assembly of all the citizens. All citizens were eligible to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city-state. However, Athenian citizens were all-male, born from parents who were born in Athens, and excluded women, slaves, foreigners (metoikoi) and males under 20 years old. Of the perhaps 250,000 inhabitants only a small plurality were citizens. The (elected) generals often held influence in the assembly. Pericles was, during his many years of de-facto political leadership, once elected general 15 years in a row. A possible example of primitive democracy may have been the early Sumerian city-states. A similar proto-democracy or oligarchy existed temporarily among the Medes (ancient Iranian people) in the 6th century BC, but which came to an end after the Achaemenid (Persian) Emperor Darius the Great declared that the best monarchy was better than the best oligarchy or best democracy. Although the term "democracy" is not often used for civilizations outside of Europe in ancient times there were organizations of government very akin to democracy in some African societies such as the Igbo nation of what is now Nigeria. A serious claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent "republics" of India, sanghas and ganas, which existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century AD. The evidence is scattered and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, Diodorus (a Greek historian at the time of Alexander the Greats excursion of India), without offering any detail, mentions that independent and democratic states existed in India. However, modern scholars note that the word democracy at the 3rd century BC and later had been degraded and could mean any autonomous state no matter how oligarchic it was. The lack of the concept of citizen equality across caste system boundaries has led many scholars to believe that the true nature of ganas and sanghas would not be comparable to that of truly democratic institutions. Even though the Roman Republic contributed significantly to certain aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of Gerrymandering, so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. However, many notable exceptions did occur.</English>

For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative, and the freedom of its citizens is secured by legitimized rights and liberties which are generally protected by a constitution. There are several varieties of democracy, some of which provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others. However, if any democracy is not structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its own favor, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy. Representative Democracy, Consensus Democracy, and Deliberative Democracy are all major examples of attempts at a form of government that is both practical and responsive to the needs and desires of citizens. Many people use the term "democracy" as shorthand for liberal democracy, which may include elements such as political pluralism; equality before the law; the right to petition elected officials for redress of grievances; due process; civil liberties; human rights; and elements of civil society outside the government. In the United States, separation of powers is often cited as a central attribute, but in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty (though in practice judicial independence is generally maintained). In other cases, "democracy" is used to mean direct democracy. Though the term "democracy" is typically used in the context of a political state, the principles are applicable to private organizations and other groups as well. Majority rule is often listed as a characteristic of democracy. However, it is also possible for a minority to be oppressed by a "tyranny of the majority" in the absence of governmental or constitutional protections of individual and/or group rights. An essential part of an "ideal" representative democracy is competitive elections that are fair both substantively and procedurally. Furthermore, freedom of political expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press are considered to be essential, so that citizens are adequately informed and able to vote according to their own best interests as they see them. It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of individuals to participate freely and fully in the life of their society. Democracy has its formal origins in Ancient Greece, but democratic practices are evident in earlier societies including Mesopotamia, Phoenicia and India. Other cultures since Greece have significantly contributed to the evolution of democracy such as Ancient Rome, Europe, and North and South America. The concept of representative democracy arose largely from ideas and institutions that developed during the European Middle Ages and the Age of Enlightenment and in the American and French Revolutions. Democracy has been called the "last form of government" and has spread considerably across the globe. The right to vote has been expanded in many jurisdictions over time from relatively narrow groups (such as wealthy men of a particular ethnic group), with New Zealand the first nation to grant universal suffrage for all its citizens in 1893. The term democracy first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in Athens during the late 6th century BCE. The philosopher Plato contrasted democracy, the system of "rule by the governed", with the alternative systems of monarchy (rule by one individual), oligarchy (rule by a small lite class) and timocracy (ruling class of property owners). Today Classical Athenian democracy is considered by many to have been a direct democracy. Originally it had two distinguishing features: first the allotment (selection by lot) of ordinary citizens to the few government offices and the courts, and secondarily the assembly of all the citizens. All citizens were eligible to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city-state. However, Athenian citizens were all-male, born from parents who were born in Athens, and excluded women, slaves, foreigners (metoikoi) and males under 20 years old. Of the perhaps 250,000 inhabitants only a small plurality were citizens. The (elected) generals often held influence in the assembly. Pericles was, during his many years of de-facto political leadership, once elected general 15 years in a row. A possible example of primitive democracy may have been the early Sumerian city-states. A similar proto-democracy or oligarchy existed temporarily among the Medes (ancient Iranian people) in the 6th century BC, but which came to an end after the Achaemenid (Persian) Emperor Darius the Great declared that the best monarchy was better than the best oligarchy or best democracy. Although the term "democracy" is not often used for civilizations outside of Europe in ancient times there were organizations of government very akin to democracy in some African societies such as the Igbo nation of what is now Nigeria. A serious claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent "republics" of India, sanghas and ganas, which existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century AD. The evidence is scattered and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, Diodorus (a Greek historian at the time of Alexander the Greats excursion of India), without offering any detail, mentions that independent and democratic states existed in India. However, modern scholars note that the word democracy at the 3rd century BC and later had been degraded and could mean any autonomous state no matter how oligarchic it was. The lack of the concept of citizen equality across caste system boundaries has led many scholars to believe that the true nature of ganas and sanghas would not be comparable to that of truly democratic institutions. Even though the Roman Republic contributed significantly to certain aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of Gerrymandering, so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. However, many notable exceptions did occur.</French>
		<German>Die Geschichte der Demokratie ist eng verkn&#252;pft mit der Entwicklung der Idee des Naturrechts, die wiederum eng verwandt ist mit dem Begriff der Menschenrechte. Ausgehend von den Naturrechten wurde die Idee der Gleichberechtigung der Freien entwickelt, die sich in den fr&#252;hen Ans&#228;tzen demokratischer Gesellschaften wiederfindet. Die Mitgestaltungsbefugnisse eines Menschen hingen zun&#228;chst vom Status der Person ab: Nur freie B&#252;rger hatten diese Rechte inne was Sklaven, Frauen und Nicht-B&#252;rger (z.B. Ausl&#228;nder) ausschloss. Als erste Verwirklichung einer Demokratie in der Geschichte wird die antike Attische Demokratie angesehen, die nach heftigem Ringen des Adels und der Reichen mit dem einfachen Volk errichtet wurde und allen m&#228;nnlichen Vollb&#252;rgern der Stadt Athen Mitbestimmung in der Regierung gew&#228;hrte, wenn man &#252;ber 20 Jahre alt war. Die Anzahl der Vollb&#252;rger betrug etwa 30.000 bis 40.000 M&#228;nner. Bei wichtigen Entscheidungen, z. B. &#252;ber Krieg und Frieden, mussten mindestens 6.000 anwesend sein. Beamte (z. B. die Archonten) wurden urspr&#252;nglich durch das Los bestimmt abgesehen von den Strategen, welche f&#252;r die Armee zust&#228;ndig waren und im Krieg eine gro&#223;e Rolle spielten. Da sie allerdings eine gro&#223;e Verantwortung trugen, wurden sie nach einer Niederlage z.T. durch das Scherbengericht f&#252;r 10 Jahre aus Attika verbannt. Diese Staatsform war nicht unumstritten, gew&#228;hrte sie doch beispielsweise den B&#252;rgern das Recht, Mitb&#252;rger, die als gef&#228;hrlich f&#252;r die Demokratie angesehen wurden, mit Hilfe des sogenannten Scherbengerichts (Ostrakismos) in die Verbannung zu schicken. Auch waren die Beschl&#252;sse der Volksversammlung leicht beeinflussbar. Demagogen spielten nicht selten eine fatale Rolle in der Politik Athens. Aufgrund der Unzufriedenheit breiter Bev&#246;lkerungsschichten im griechischen Mutterland in sp&#228;tarchaischer Zeit (7. und 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr.) und des Vorhandenseins unabh&#228;ngigen und &#246;ffentlichen politischen Denkens, kam es zuerst zur Vorstufe der Demokratie, der Isonomie. Nicht zuletzt aufgrund der Erfolge der freien griechischen Poleis w&#228;hrend der Perserkriege wurde diese Entwicklung beschleunigt und fand ihren Endpunkt in der attischen Demokratie, in der die B&#252;rger in Athen die M&#246;glichkeit bekamen, in einer auf breiteren Schichten basierenden politischen Ordnung mitzuwirken.</German>
		<Italian>Democracy is a form of government in which all citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Ideally, this includes equal (and more or less direct) participation in the proposal, development and passage of legislation into law. It can also encompass social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. The term comes from the Greek: demokratia "rule of the people",which was coined from Demos "people" and Kratos "power", in the middle of the 5th-4th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens following a popular uprising in 508 BC. According to some theories of democracy, popular sovereignty is the founding principle of such a system. However, the democratic principle has also been expressed as "the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known." This type of freedom, which is connected to human "natality," or the capacity to begin anew, sees democracy as "not only a political system [but] an ideal, an aspiration, really, intimately connected to and dependent upon a picture of what it is to be humanof what it is a human should be to be fully human."

		<Spanish>Democracia es una forma de organizaci&#243;n de grupos de personas, cuya caracter&#237;stica predominante es que la titularidad del poder reside en la totalidad de sus miembros, haciendo que la toma de decisiones responda a la voluntad colectiva de los miembros del grupo. En sentido estricto la democracia es una forma de organizaci&#243;n del Estado, en la cual las decisiones colectivas son adoptadas por el pueblo mediante mecanismos de participaci&#243;n directa o indirecta que le confieren legitimidad a los representantes. En sentido amplio, democracia es una forma de convivencia social en la que los miembros son libres e iguales y las relaciones sociales se establecen de acuerdo a mecanismos contractuales. La democracia se define tambi&#233;n a partir de la cl&#225;sica clasificaci&#243;n de las formas de gobierno realizada por Plat&#243;n, primero, y Arist&#243;teles, despu&#233;s, en tres tipos b&#225;sicos: monarqu&#237;a (gobierno de uno), aristocracia (gobierno de los mejores para Plat&#243;n, de los menos, para Arist&#243;teles), democracia (gobierno de la multitud para Plat&#243;n y de los m&#225;s, para Arist&#243;teles). Hay democracia directa cuando la decisi&#243;n es adoptada directamente por los miembros del pueblo. Hay democracia indirecta o representativa cuando la decisi&#243;n es adoptada por personas reconocidas por el pueblo como sus representantes. Por &#250;ltimo, hay democracia participativa cuando se aplica un modelo pol&#237;tico que facilita a los ciudadanos su capacidad de asociarse y organizarse de tal modo que puedan ejercer una influencia directa en las decisiones p&#250;blicas o cuando se facilita a la ciudadan&#237;a amplios mecanismos plebiscitarios. Estas tres formas no son excluyentes y suelen integrarse como mecanismos complementarios. No debe confundirse Rep&#250;blica con Democracia, pues aluden a principios distintos, la rep&#250;blica es el gobierno de la ley mientras que democracia significa el gobierno de la mayor&#237;a.[PARAGRAPH:2] El t&#233;rmino democracia proviene del antiguo griego (??????????) y fue acu&#241;ado en Atenas en el siglo V a. C. a partir de los vocablos demos, que puede traducirse como pueblo y kr&#225;tos, que puede traducirse como poder. Sin embargo la significaci&#243;n etimol&#243;gica del t&#233;rmino es mucho m&#225;s compleja. El t&#233;rmino demos parece haber sido un neologismo derivado de la fusi&#243;n de las palabras demiurgos (demiurgi) y geomoros (geomori). El historiador Plutarco se&#241;alaba que los geomoros y demiurgos, eran junto a los eup&#225;tridas, las tres clases en las que Teseo dividi&#243; a la poblaci&#243;n libre del &#193;tica (adicionalmente la poblaci&#243;n estaba integrada tambi&#233;n por los metecos, esclavos y las mujeres). Los eup&#225;tridas eran los nobles; los demiurgos eran los artesanos; y los geomoros eran los campesinos. Estos dos &#250;ltimos grupos, en creciente oposici&#243;n a la nobleza, formaron el demos. Textualmente entonces, democracia significa gobierno de los artesanos y campesinos, excluyendo del mismo expresamente a los esclavos y a los nobles. Algunos pensadores consideran a la democracia ateniense como el primer ejemplo de un sistema democr&#225;tico. Otros pensadores han criticado esta conclusi&#243;n, argumentando por un lado que tanto en la organizaci&#243;n tribal como en antiguas civilizaciones en todo el mundo existen ejemplos de sistemas pol&#237;ticos democr&#225;ticos, y por otro lado que solo una peque&#241;a minor&#237;a del 10% de la poblaci&#243;n ten&#237;a derecho a participar de la llamada democracia ateniense, quedando autom&#225;ticamente excluidos la mayor&#237;a de trabajadores, campesinos, esclavos y las mujeres. De todas formas, el significado del t&#233;rmino ha cambiado con el tiempo, y la definici&#243;n moderna ha evolucionado mucho, sobre todo desde finales del siglo XVIII, con la sucesiva introducci&#243;n de sistemas democr&#225;ticos en muchas naciones y sobre todo a partir del reconocimiento del sufragio universal y del voto femenino en el siglo XX. Hoy en d&#237;a, las democracias existentes son bastante distintas al sistema de gobierno ateniense del que heredan su nombre.</Spanish>

		<Spanish>El liderazgo es el conjunto de capacidades que un individuo tiene para influir en la mente de las personas o en un grupo de personas determinado, haciendo que este equipo trabaje con entusiasmo, en el logro de metas y objetivos. Tambi&#233;n se entiende como la capacidad de tomar la iniciativa, gestionar, convocar, promover, incentivar, motivar y evaluar a un grupo o equipo.

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_ASKLEPIEION_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>In ancient Greece and Rome, an asclepeion (or asklepieion) was a healing temple, sacred to the god Asclepius. Asclepius was probably first worshipped as a hero in Trikka, Thessaly, which ancient mythographers generally regarded as the place of his birth. Epidauros, on the other hand, was the first place to worship Asclepius as a god, beginning sometime in the 400s BC. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The cure often consisted of the patient sleeping in the temple of Asclepius, which was mostly outside the city. In a dream, Asklepios appeared to him and gave the patient diets or other methods of treatment. The cult was closely related to the underworld. Sacred snakes were kept in its sanctuaries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The asclepieion at Epidaurus is both extensive and well preserved. There is an asclepieion located on the south slopes of the Acropolis of Athens which dates to around 420 BC. Starting around 350 BC, the cult of Asclepius became increasingly popular. Pilgrims flocked to asclepieia to be healed. They slept overnight ("incubation") and reported their dreams to a priest the following day. He prescribed a cure, often a visit to the baths or a gymnasium. Since snakes were sacred to Asclepius, they were often used in healing rituals. Non-venomous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. Asclepeia provided carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing. In the Asclepieion of Epidaurus, three large marble boards dated to 350 BC preserve the names, case histories, complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the temple with a problem and shed it there. Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, but with the patient in a dream-like state of induced sleep known as "enkoimesis" not unlike anesthesia, induced with the help of soporific substances such as opium. Pausanias remarked that, at the asclepieion of Titane in Sicyon (founded by Alexanor, Asclepius grandson), statues of Hygieia were covered by womens hair and pieces of Babylonian clothes. According to inscriptions, the same sacrifices were offered at Paros. Hippocrates is said to have received his medical training at an asclepieion on the isle of Kos.

Dans un r&#234;ve, Asklepios lui est apparu et a donn&#233; au patient des r&#233;gimes ou d'autres m&#233;thodes de traitement. Le culte &#233;tait &#233;troitement li&#233; au monde souterrain.

Il y a un asclepieion situ&#233; sur les pentes sud de l'Acropole d'Ath&#232;nes qui date d'environ 420 av. &#192; partir d'environ 350 avant JC, le culte d'Ascl&#233;pios est devenu de plus en plus populaire. Les p&#232;lerins affluaient vers asclepieia pour &#234;tre gu&#233;ris.

		<German>Ein Asklepieion (nach Asklepios, dem altgriechischen Gott der Heilkunst, lateinisch Aesculapium) ist ein antikes griechisches Heiligtum (Tempel) des Asklepios, meist mit angeschlossenem Sanatorium. Etwa 300 dieser Heilst&#228;tten sind bekannt. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Die Heilung bestand oft darin, dass der Kranke im meist au&#223;erhalb der Stadt gelegenen Tempel des Asklepios schlief. Im Traum erschien ihm Asklepios und gab dem Patienten Di&#228;ten oder andere Behandlungsmethoden auf. Der Kult war eng mit der Unterwelt verbunden. In seinen Heiligt&#252;mern wurden heilige Schlangen aufbewahrt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Besondere Erw&#228;hnung verdienen die Anlagen von Epidauros, von Trikka in Thessalien, das Asklepieion von Kos sowie die Asklepieia von Messene und Pergamon. Die Anlage in Epidauros ist die bedeutendste ihrer Art, sie diente auch als Vorbild f&#252;r den Bau auf Kos. Dem Asklepieion von Trikka kommt besondere Bedeutung zu, da der Kult um den Gott Asklepios, Sohn des Apollon und Schutzpatron der Heilkunst, in Thessalien seinen Ursprung hatte und von dort aus die gesamte antike griechische Welt eroberte. Die Anlage auf der Insel Kos verdankt ihre Bedeutung Hippokrates, dem wohl bedeutendsten Arzt der Antike, der auf Kos geboren wurde. Wahrscheinlich wurde die Heilst&#228;tte aber erst nach seinem Tod errichtet.</German>
		<Italian>Nell'antica Grecia e Roma, un asclepeion (o asklepieion) era un tempio di guarigione, sacro al dio Asclepio. Asclepio fu probabilmente adorato per la prima volta come eroe a Trikka, in Tessaglia, che gli antichi mitografi generalmente consideravano il luogo della sua nascita. Epidauro, d'altra parte, fu il primo luogo ad adorare Asclepio come un dio, a partire dal 400 aC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La cura consisteva spesso nel dormire il paziente nel tempio di Asclepio, che si trovava per lo pi&#249; fuori citt&#224;. In sogno, gli apparve Asclepio e diede al paziente diete o altri metodi di trattamento. Il culto era strettamente legato alla malavita. Nei suoi santuari erano custoditi serpenti sacri.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]L'asclepieion di Epidauro &#232; ampio e ben conservato. C'&#232; un asclepieion situato sulle pendici meridionali dell'Acropoli di Atene che risale al 420 a.C. circa. A partire dal 350 aC circa, il culto di Asclepio divenne sempre pi&#249; popolare. I pellegrini accorrevano ad Asclepieia per essere guariti. Dormivano durante la notte ("incubazione") e il giorno seguente riferivano i loro sogni a un prete. Ha prescritto una cura, spesso una visita ai bagni o una palestra. Poich&#233; i serpenti erano sacri ad Asclepio, venivano spesso usati nei rituali di guarigione. Serpenti non velenosi venivano lasciati strisciare sul pavimento nei dormitori dove dormivano i malati e i feriti. Asclepeia forniva spazi attentamente controllati che favorivano la guarigione e soddisfaceva molti dei requisiti delle istituzioni create per la guarigione. Nell'Asclepieion di Epidauro, tre grandi tavole marmoree datate 350 aC conservano nomi, casi clinici, lamentele e guarigioni di circa 70 pazienti che arrivarono al tempio con un problema e lo versarono l&#236;. Alcune delle cure chirurgiche elencate, come l'apertura di un ascesso addominale o la rimozione di materiale estraneo traumatico, sono abbastanza realistiche da essere avvenute, ma con il paziente in uno stato onirico di sonno indotto noto come "enkoimesi" non a differenza dell'anestesia, indotta con l'ausilio di sostanze soporifere come l'oppio. Pausania osserv&#242; che, all'asclepieion di Titane a Sicione (fondata da Alessandro, nipote di Asclepio), le statue di Igea erano coperte da capelli femminili e pezzi di vestiti babilonesi. Secondo le iscrizioni, gli stessi sacrifici venivano offerti a Paros. Si dice che Ippocrate abbia ricevuto la sua formazione medica in un asclepieion sull'isola di Kos. Prima di diventare il medico personale dell'imperatore romano Marco Aurelio, Galeno cur&#242; e studi&#242; presso il famoso asclepieion di Pergamo.</Italian>

Pausanias comentaba que, en el asclepeion de Titane en Sici&#243;n (fundado por Alexanor, nieto de Asclepio), las estatuas de Hig&#237;a eran cubiertas de cabellos de mujer y trozos de ropas babilonias. Seg&#250;n las inscripciones, los mismos sacrificios eran ofrecidos en Paros. Se ha dicho que Hip&#243;crates recibi&#243; su formaci&#243;n m&#233;dica en un Asclepeion de la isla de Cos.

El asclepeion m&#225;s antiguo estaba en Tricca (la actual Trikkala), en Tesalia. El Asclepeion de Epidauro, tradicionalmente considerado el lugar de nacimiento de Asclepio, es el mayor y mejor conservado. Hay un asclepeion localizado en la ladera sur de la Acr&#243;polis de Atenas, que data de aproximadamente del 420 a. C. Hubo otro santuario de Asclepio al este de la antigua ciudad laconia de Asopo, lugar de culto de los eleuterol&#225;cones. Se ha localizado cerca de Foiniki.</Spanish>

		<English>Pythagoras of Samos was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and founder of the religious movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and might have travelled widely in his youth, visiting Egypt and other places seeking knowledge. He had a teacher named Themistoclea, who introduced him to the principles of ethics. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, a Greek colony in southern Italy, and there set up a religious sect. His followers pursued the religious rites and practices developed by Pythagoras, and studied his philosophical theories. The society took an active role in the politics of Croton, but this eventually led to their downfall. The Pythagorean meeting-places were burned, and Pythagoras was forced to flee the city. He is said to have ended his days in Metapontum. Pythagoras made influential contributions to philosophy and religious teaching in the late 6th century BC. He is often revered as a great mathematician, mystic and scientist, but he is best known for the Pythagorean theorem which bears his name. However, because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than with the other pre-Socratic philosophers, one can give account of his teachings to a little extent, and some have questioned whether he contributed much to mathematics and natural philosophy. Many of the accomplishments credited to Pythagoras may actually have been accomplishments of his colleagues and successors. Whether or not his disciples believed that everything was related to mathematics and that numbers were the ultimate reality is unknown. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom, and Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato, and through him, all of Western philosophy. Since the fourth century AD, Pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the Pythagorean theorem, a theorem in geometry that states that in a right-angled triangle the area of the square on the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sidesthat is, a2 + b2 = c2. While the theorem that now bears his name was known and previously utilized by the Babylonians and Indians, he, or his students, are often said to have constructed the first proof. It must, however, be stressed that the way in which the Babylonians handled Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources. Because of the secretive nature of his school and the custom of its students to attribute everything to their teacher, there is no evidence that Pythagoras himself worked on or proved this theorem. For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or meta-mathematical problems. Some attribute it as a carefully constructed myth by followers of Plato over two centuries after the death of Pythagoras, mainly to bolster the case for Platonic meta-physics, which resonate well with the ideas they attributed to Pythagoras. This attribution has stuck down the centuries up to modern times. The earliest known mention of Pythagorass name in connection with the theorem occurred five centuries after his death, in the writings of Cicero and Plutarch.</English>

		<German>Pythagoras stammte von der griechischen Insel Samos. Er emigrierte zwischen 532 und 529 v. Chr in ein damals von Griechen besiedeltes Gebiet Unteritaliens, wo er sich zun&#228;chst in Kroton (heute Crotone in Kalabrien) niederlie&#223;. Dort gr&#252;ndete er die Schule, die von Anfang an neben den Studien auch politische Ziele verfolgte. Am Krieg zwischen Kroton und der ebenfalls griechischen Stadt Sybaris, der von Sybaris ausging und mit gro&#223;er Brutalit&#228;t ausgetragen wurde, nahmen die Pythagoreer aktiv teil. Der Befehlshaber des Heeres der Krotoniaten, der ber&#252;hmte Athlet Milon, war Pythagoreer. Nach dem Sieg &#252;ber Sybaris, das erobert und gepl&#252;ndert wurde (510 v.Chr.), wurden die Pythagoreer in heftige Auseinandersetzungen innerhalb der B&#252;rgerschaft von Kroton verwickelt. Dabei ging es um die Verteilung des eroberten Landes und um eine Verfassungs&#228;nderung. Wegen dieser Unruhen verlegte Pythagoras seinen Wohnsitz nach Metapontion (heute Metaponto in der Basilikata). Dort setzte er seine Lehrt&#228;tigkeit fort, w&#228;hrend in Kroton seine hart bedr&#228;ngten Anh&#228;nger unterlagen und vor&#252;bergehend die Stadt verlassen mussten. Als Anf&#252;hrer der gegnerischen Partei trat ein vornehmer B&#252;rger namens Kylon hervor (daher "kylonische Unruhen"), und auch ein Volksredner namens Ninon hetzte gegen die Pythagoreer. Da die Schule &#252;ber eine erhebliche Ausstrahlungskraft verf&#252;gte, bildeten sich auch in anderen griechischen St&#228;dten Unteritaliens Pythagoreergemeinschaften, die wohl auch dort in die Politik eingriffen. Eine institutionalisierte Herrschaft der Pythagoreer hat es aber weder in Kroton noch in Metapontion oder anderswo gegeben, sondern nur eine mehr oder weniger erfolgreiche Einflussnahme auf den jeweiligen Rat der Stadt und auf die B&#252;rgerversammlung. Mehrere Quellen berichten, dass der Pythagoreismus sich auch in der nichtgriechischen Bev&#246;lkerung verbreitete. Genannt werden u.a. die St&#228;mme der Lukanier und Messapier. Pythagoras starb in den letzten Jahren des 6. Jahrhunderts oder im fr&#252;hen 5. Jahrhundert. Nach seinem Tod setzten seine Sch&#252;ler ihre Aktivit&#228;ten in den St&#228;dten fort. Es bestand nun aber wohl keine zentrale Lenkung der Schule mehr, denn Pythagoras hatte anscheinend keinen Nachfolger als allgemein anerkanntes Schuloberhaupt. Die Pythagoreer waren gem&#228;&#223; ihrer insgesamt auf Harmonie und Stabilit&#228;t ausgerichteten Weltanschauung politisch konservativ. Dadurch wurden sie zu Verb&#252;ndeten der traditionell in den Stadtr&#228;ten dominierenden Geschlechter. Sie stie&#223;en aber, wie das Beispiel Kylons zeigt, in den einflussreichen Familien auch auf Opposition. Ihre nat&#252;rlichen Feinde waren &#252;berall die Agitatoren, die f&#252;r einen Umsturz und f&#252;r die Einf&#252;hrung der Demokratie eintraten und nur auf diesem Wege Macht erlangen konnten. Um die Mitte des 5. Jahrhunderts oder etwas sp&#228;ter kamen in einer Reihe von St&#228;dten demokratisch gesinnte Volksredner an die Macht. Sie gingen, damaliger Sitte folgend, mit gro&#223;er H&#228;rte gegen die Anh&#228;nger der unterlegenen Partei vor. Daher kam es zu blutigen Verfolgungen der Pythagoreer, die entweder get&#246;tet wurden oder aus den St&#228;dten fliehen mussten. Die politischen Wirren hielten anscheinend l&#228;ngere Zeit an. Dabei konnten die Pythagoreer sich zeitweilig wieder durchsetzen; schlie&#223;lich unterlagen sie jedoch &#252;berall au&#223;er in Tarent, wo sie noch bis um die Mitte des 4. Jahrhunderts eine starke Stellung hatten. Viele von ihnen emigrierten nach Griechenland. Die Schule h&#246;rte als Organisation zu bestehen auf.</German>

		<Spanish>Pit&#225;goras de Samos (ca. 580 a. C.-ca. 495 a. C.) fue un fil&#243;sofo y matem&#225;tico griego, considerado el primer matem&#225;tico puro. Contribuy&#243; de manera significativa en el avance de la matem&#225;tica hel&#233;nica, la geometr&#237;a y la aritm&#233;tica derivada particularmente de las relaciones num&#233;ricas, aplicadas por ejemplo a la teor&#237;a de pesos y medidas, a la teor&#237;a de la m&#250;sica o la astronom&#237;a. Es el fundador de la Hermandad Pitag&#243;rica, una sociedad que, si bien era de naturaleza predominantemente religiosa, se interesaba tambi&#233;n en medicina, cosmolog&#237;a, filosof&#237;a, &#233;tica y pol&#237;tica, entre otras disciplinas; el pitagorismo formul&#243; principios que influenciaron tanto a Plat&#243;n como a Arist&#243;teles, y de manera m&#225;s general, al posterior desarrollo de la matem&#225;tica y la filosof&#237;a racional en Occidente. No se conserva ning&#250;n escrito original de Pit&#225;goras, y sus disc&#237;pulos -los pitag&#243;ricos- invariablemente justificaban sus doctrinas citando la autoridad del maestro de forma indiscriminada, por lo que es dif&#237;cil distinguir entre los hallazgos de Pit&#225;goras y las de sus seguidores. Se le acredita a Pit&#225;goras la teor&#237;a de la significaci&#243;n funcional de los n&#250;meros en el mundo objetivo y en m&#250;sica; otros descubrimientos (la inconmensurabilidad del lado y la diagonal del cuadrado, o el teorema de Pit&#225;goras para los tri&#225;ngulos rect&#225;ngulos) fueron probablemente desarrollados posteriormente por la escuela pitag&#243;rica.</Spanish>

		<English>A heroon (plural heroa), also called heroum, was a shrine dedicated to an ancient Greek or Roman hero and used for the commemoration or cult worship of the hero. It was often erected over his supposed tomb or cenotaph. The Romans and the Greeks practised an extensive and widespread cult of heroes. Heroes played a central role in the life of a polis, giving the city a shared focus for its identity. The cult typically centred around the heroon in which the heros bones were usually believed to be contained. In a sense, the hero was considered still to be alive; he was offered meals and was imagined to be sharing feasts. His allegiance was seen as vitally important to the continued well-being of the city. This led to struggles between Greek cities for control of heroic remains. Many examples of heroa can be found around the tholos tombs of Mycenaean Greece and in or near the sacred areas of a number of Greek cities around the Mediterranean. A particularly well-preserved example, the so-called Tomb of Theron, can be found at Agrigento in Sicily. Another notable one, at Vergina in Greek Macedonia (the ancient city of Aigai), is thought to have been dedicated to the worship of the family of Alexander the Great and may have housed the cult statue of Alexanders father, Philip II of Macedon. A well-preserved Roman heroon from the Augustan period is situated in the ancient city of Sagalassos in what is now Turkey. Another well-preserved and well-known heroon is the Library of Celsus in Ephesus, Turkey. It was built to honor a Roman senator, Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, a consul and proconsul of Asia from 92 to 107 and governor of Asia when he died in 114.</English>

A well-preserved Roman heroon from the Augustan period is situated in the ancient city of Sagalassos in what is now Turkey. Another well-preserved and well-known heroon is the Library of Celsus in Ephesus, Turkey. It was built to honor a Roman senator, Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, a consul and proconsul of Asia from 92 to 107 and governor of Asia when he died in 114.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Un heroon (plural heroa), tambi&#233;n escrito como heroum, era un santuario dedicado por los antiguos griegos y romanos (y en ciertos casos por otros pueblos como los iberos) como lugar de culto o conmemoraci&#243;n de un h&#233;roe, erigido frecuentemente sobre su supuesta tumba o cenotafio. El culto a los h&#233;roes era una pr&#225;ctica muy extendida entre dichos pueblos. El h&#233;roe ten&#237;a un papel central en la vida de la polis, dando a la ciudad un referente para su identidad. El culto habitualmente se centraba alrededor del heroon, en el cual se cre&#237;a reposaban los huesos del h&#233;roe. Se le hac&#237;an ofrendas, comidas y se hac&#237;a consideraci&#243;n de que el h&#233;roe a&#250;n estaba vivo y compart&#237;a esas ofrendas. La "posesi&#243;n" de un h&#233;roe por una determinada ciudad era visto como algo fundamental para el buen devenir de &#233;sta. Esta superstici&#243;n llev&#243; a algunas ciudades griegas a enfrentamientos por el control de restos considerados heroicos.</Spanish>

		<English>A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault. The term derives from sedere, Latin for "to sit". Generally speaking, siege warfare is a form of constant, low intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. A siege occurs when an attacker encounters a city or fortress that cannot be easily taken by a coup de main and refuses to surrender. Sieges involve surrounding the target and blocking the reinforcement or escape of troops or provision of supplies (a tactic known as "investment"), typically coupled with attempts to reduce the fortifications by means of siege engines, artillery bombardment, mining (also known as sapping), or the use of deception or treachery to bypass defenses. Failing a military outcome, sieges can often be decided by starvation, thirst or disease, which can afflict either the attacker or defender. Sieges probably predate the development of cities as large population centers. Ancient cities in the Middle East show archaeological evidence of having had fortified city walls. During the Warring States era of ancient China, there is both textual and archaeological evidence of prolonged sieges and siege machinery used against the defenders of city walls. Siege machinery was also a tradition of the ancient Greco-Roman world. Alexander the Greats Macedonian army successfully besieged many powerful cities during his astounding conquests. Two of his most impressive achievements in siegecraft took place in the Siege of Tyre and the Siege of the Sogdian Rock. His engineers built a causeway that was originally 60 m (200 ft) wide and reached the range of his torsion-powered artillery, while his soldiers pushed siege towers housing stone throwers and light catapults to bombard the city walls. Most conquerors before him had found Tyre, a Phoenician island-city about 1 km from the mainland, impregnable. The Macedonians built a mole, a raised spit of earth across the water, by piling stones up on a natural land bridge that extended underwater to the island, and although the Tyrians rallied by sending a fire-ship to destroy the towers, and captured the mole in a swarming frenzy, the city eventually fell to the Macedonians after a seven-month siege. In complete contrast to Tyre, Sogdian Rock was captured by stealthy attack. Alexander used commando-like tactics to scale the cliffs and capture the high ground, and the demoralized defenders surrendered. The importance of siege warfare in the ancient period should not be underestimated. One of the contributing causes of Hannibals inability to defeat Rome was his lack of a siege train, thus, while he was able to defeat Roman armies in the field, he was unable to capture Rome itself. The legionary armies of the Roman Republic and Empire are noted as being particularly skilled and determined in siege warfare. An astonishing number and variety of sieges, for example, formed the core of Julius Caesars mid-1st century BC conquest of Gaul.</English>

		<German>Die Belagerung ist eine Sonderform des Angriffs, die angewendet wird, um befestigte Anlagen zu erobern, deren Kampfkraft abzunutzen oder zumindest zeitweise zu neutralisieren. Hierbei wird der Ort dergestalt von eigenen Truppen umschlossen, dass m&#246;glichst jeder Verkehr zwischen dem Inneren und dem &#196;u&#223;eren des Belagerungsrings unterbunden wird. Insbesondere soll der Nachschub an Soldaten, Waffen und Nahrung unterbunden werden. Belagerungen sind zumeist mit dem Einsatz von Belagerungsger&#228;t verbunden. Von der fr&#252;hgeschichtlichen Zeit bis in die Fr&#252;he Neuzeit stellte die Belagerung ein wesentliches Element der Kriegsf&#252;hrung dar. Der technischen Weiterentwicklung der Befestigungsanlagen stand auf der anderen Seite die Weiterentwicklung der Belagerungstechniken entgegen. Bedeutende Wissenschaftler und Ingenieure waren an dieser Weiterentwicklung beteiligt, so etwa in der Antike Philon von Byzanz (3. Jh. v. Chr.), Heron von Alexandria (1. Jh. n. Chr.), Apollodorus von Damaskus (1.-2. Jh. n. Chr.), Biton, Archimedes (um 285-212 v.Chr.), Aeneas Tycitus, Aelian, Athenaeus, Apollodrus von Damaskus und Ammianus Marcellinus, der sog. Anonymus, die sowohl Festungsanlagen als auch Kriegsmaschinen entwarfen. Ziel einer Belagerung ist eine befestigte Anlage des Gegners soweit zu schw&#228;chen, dass ein Sturmangriff erfolgversprechend wird oder die Verteidiger in eine Kapitulation einwilligen. Da eine Belagerung zu allen Zeiten aufwendig und langwierig war, wurde h&#228;ufig versucht, durch Ausnutzung eines &#220;berraschungsmoments, List oder Verrat eine Belagerung zu vermeiden. &#220;berraschungsangriffe und handstreichartige &#220;berf&#228;lle auf intakte Festungsanlagen sind jedoch riskant, scheitern h&#228;ufig und k&#246;nnen f&#252;r den Angreifer ausgesprochen verlustreich verlaufen.</German>

		<Spanish>Un asedio o sitio es un bloqueo militar prolongado a una fortaleza, que suele ir acompa&#241;ado del asalto a &#233;sta, con el objetivo de su conquista mediante la fuerza o el desgaste. Tiene lugar cuando un atacante se encuentra con una ciudad o fortaleza que rechaza la rendici&#243;n y no puede ser tomada f&#225;cilmente mediante un asalto frontal. Suele conllevar el rodeo del objetivo y el bloqueo de las l&#237;neas de abastecimiento, normalmente apoyado por maquinaria de asedio, bombardeo de artiller&#237;a y la construcci&#243;n de t&#250;neles subterr&#225;neos para reducir las fortificaciones. Los asedios probablemente surgen en la historia junto con el desarrollo de las ciudades a grandes centros de poblaci&#243;n. Las ciudades antiguas de Oriente Medio, por ejemplo, ya muestran restos arqueol&#243;gicos de murallas fortificadas. Durante el Renacimiento y la Edad Moderna, los asedios dominaron la forma de guerra en Europa hasta tal punto que Leonardo da Vinci, por ejemplo, gan&#243; gran parte de su renombre mediante el dise&#241;o de fortificaciones en su estudio. Las campa&#241;as medievales generalmente se dise&#241;aban mediante una sucesi&#243;n de asedios. Sin embargo, en la era Napole&#243;nica, el uso cada vez mayor de ca&#241;ones muy poderosos fue reduciendo el valor de las fortificaciones, de forma que ya en los tiempos modernos, las trincheras sustituyeron a las murallas, y los b&#250;nkeres reemplazaron a los castillos. Ya en el siglo XX la importancia del asedio cl&#225;sico fue declinando debido a la llegada de la guerra m&#243;vil. Una fortificaci&#243;n concreta dej&#243; de ser tan decisiva como lo era antes y, por ello, aunque todav&#237;a se producen asedios concretos, ya no son tan importantes ni tan comunes como lo fueron antes, dados los cambios en los medios de guerra y, sobre todo, por la facilidad con que hoy en d&#237;a se pueden dirigir grandes vol&#250;menes de poder destructivo contra un solo objetivo est&#225;tico.</Spanish>

		<English>Mars was the Roman god of war and also an agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome. He was second in importance only to Jupiter, and he was the most prominent of the military gods worshipped by the Roman legions. His festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, which began and ended the season for military campaigning and farming. Under the influence of Greek culture, Mars was identified with the Greek god Ares, whose myths were reinterpreted in Roman literature and art under the name of Mars. But the character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in Greek literature. Mars was a part of the Archaic Triad along with Jupiter and Quirinus, the latter of whom as a guardian of the Roman people had no Greek equivalent. Mars altar in the Campus Martius, the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by Numa himself, the peace-loving semi-legendary second king of Rome. Although the center of Mars worship was originally located outside the pomerium, or sacred boundary of Rome, Augustus brought the god into the center of Roman religion by establishing the Temple of Mars Ultor in his new forum.</English>

		<German>Mars war ein Gott im antiken Italien, vor allem in Rom. Er wurde sp&#228;ter mit dem griechischen Ares gleichgesetzt, unterschied sich von diesem aber durch seine gr&#246;&#223;ere Bedeutung und die lebhaftere kultische Verehrung; er ist neben Jupiter der wichtigste r&#246;mische Gott. Die Namen "Ares" und "Mars" k&#246;nnten auch etymologisch verwandt sein. Wie Ares galt Mars als Gott des Krieges, aber gewisse Einzelheiten in seinem Kult deuten auch darauf, dass er als Agrargottheit mit dem Gedeihen der Vegetation verbunden wurde. Priester des Mars in Rom war der Flamen Martialis; au&#223;erdem f&#252;hrten die Salii Palatini Kulthandlungen f&#252;r ihn durch. Beim Fest des Mars (wie auch des Quirinus) zog die Tanzpriesterschaft in alter Kriegsbekleidung singend und tanzend durch Rom. Urspr&#252;nglich wurde Mars au&#223;erhalb der Stadt, auf dem nach ihm benannten Marsfeld (Campus Martius) verehrt. Nach Mars wurde der dritte Wochentag genannt, daher it. martedi, frz. mardi. Die Germanen setzten ihn mit Tiu gleich, daher Dienstag. Im keltischen Raum wurde Mars mit zahlreichen einheimischen G&#246;ttern identifiziert. Attribut des Mars ist die Lanze, gezeigt wird er auch mit Helm und Schild sowie Schwert. Zeichen des Mars ist ein Kreis mit einem nach rechts oben gerichtetem Pfeil, auch als Symbol der M&#228;nnlichkeit bekannt. Ihm heilig sind Wolf, Stier, Pferd, Greifv&#246;gel, Geier, Hahn und Specht sowie das Gras. Der lateinische Name "Marcus" bedeutet "dem Mars geweiht". Der rote Planet Mars ist nach diesem Gott benannt. Und hat etwas einen eindeutig kriegerischen Zusammenhang, spricht man heute noch von "martialisch", also "dem Gott Mars zugeh&#246;rig".</German>

		<Spanish>En la mitolog&#237;a romana, Marte, en lat&#237;n Mars, era el dios de la guerra, hijo de J&#250;piter en forma de flor y de Juno. Se le representaba como a un guerrero con armadura y con un yelmo encrestado. El lobo y el p&#225;jaro carpintero eran sus s&#237;mbolos. Tuvo dos hijos con Venus: Fuga y Timor (respectivamente Deimos y Fobos para los griegos). El dios Marte proviene del Ares griego de Tracia, donde su culto no estaba muy difundido, y no ten&#237;a repercusiones morales o sociales. Ya exist&#237;a, en cambio, esta deidad en Atenas, donde ten&#237;a un templo en el Are&#243;pago (en griego, 'colina de Ares'). Antes de la guerra se le ofrec&#237;an sacrificios, y aparec&#237;a en las batallas acompa&#241;ado por la diosa guerrera Belona (cuyo nombre deriva del arcaico it&#225;lico Duellona), una divinidad originalmente sabina, de nombre Nerio, que por otra v&#237;a fue m&#225;s tarde identificada con Minerva. Llevaba un casco, un escudo, una lanza y una antorcha, por lo que tambi&#233;n se identific&#243; err&#243;neamente con la diosa Enio, divinidad griega de la guerra, hija de la hermana gemela de Ares, Eris diosa de la discordia. Marte dio nombre al cuarto planeta del sistema solar por su color rojo similitud con la sangre de las guerras: Marte, al segundo (o tercero seg&#250;n algunas religiones, calendarios o regiones como en EE.UU.) d&#237;a de la semana: Martes y al tercer mes del a&#241;o: marzo. [NEWLINE] El Marte romano original era el dios de la fertilidad, la vegetaci&#243;n y el ganado, aunque para otros era el dios de la guerra, al igual que en Grecia; asimilaci&#243;n que perdura por su identificaci&#243;n con Ares.</Spanish>

		<English>The Trojan Horse is a tale from the Trojan War, as told in Virgil's Latin epic poem The Aeneid, also by Dionysius, Apollodorus and Quintus of Smyrna. The events in this story from the Bronze Age took place after Homer's Iliad, and before his Odyssey. It was the stratagem that allowed the Greeks finally to enter the city of Troy and end the conflict (1194 until 1184 BC).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, Odysseus came up with the idea of building a great wooden horse (the horse being the emblem of Troy), hiding a select force inside, and fooling the Trojans into wheeling the horse into the city as a trophy. Under the leadership of Epeios, the Greeks built the wooden horse in three days. Odysseus' plan called for one man to remain outside of the horse; he would act as though the Greeks abandoned him, leaving the horse as a gift for the Trojans. A Greek soldier named Sinon was the only volunteer for the role. Virgil describes the actual encounter between Sinon and the Trojans: Sinon successfully convinces the Trojans that he has been left behind and that the Greeks are gone. Sinon tells the Trojans that the Horse is an offering to the goddess Athena, meant to atone for the previous desecration of her temple at Troy by the Greeks, and ensure a safe journey home for the Greek fleet. The Horse was built on such a huge size to prevent the Trojans from taking the offering into their city, and thus garnering the favor of Athena for themselves.</English>

		<German>Das Trojanische Pferd war in der griechischen Mythologie ein hlzernes Pferd, in dessen Bauch Soldaten versteckt waren. Die Soldaten ffneten nachts die Stadtmauern Trojas von innen und lieen das Heer der Griechen ein. Mit dieser Kriegslist gewannen die antiken Griechen den Trojanischen Krieg (1194 bis 1184 v. Chr).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Nachdem die Griechen im Trojanischen Krieg lange erfolglos um die Mauern von Troja gekmpft hatten, rief der Seher Kalchas eine Versammlung der vornehmsten Helden zusammen und riet ihnen, Troja nicht mit Gewalt, sondern mit Hilfe einer List zu erobern. In anderen Quellen werden Odysseus oder dessen Gefangener Helenos als Urheber der List genannt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Die Griechen bauten darauf hin im zehnten Kriegsjahr ein groes Holzpferd, in dessen Inneren sich griechische Soldaten versteckten. Das Pferd wurde vom griechischen Helden Epeios erschaffen, dem im Traum die Gttin Pallas Athene erschienen war und ihm aufgetragen hatte, das mchtige Ross aus Balken zu zimmern, indem sie selbst ihren Beistand zur schnelleren Vollendung des Werkes versprach. Mit Athenes Hilfe und der Untersttzung der Atriden schaffte er es, sein perfektes Kunstwerk innerhalb von drei Tagen zu vollenden. Nachdem die Armee, die Troja belagerte, den Abzug vorgetuscht hatte, holten die Trojaner das Pferd trotz vorheriger Warnung des Laokoon vor dem Danaergeschenk in die Stadt, da sie es fr ein Abschiedsgeschenk der Griechen an deren Untersttzer Poseidon hielten, womit sie zugleich den Meeresgott, ihren Feind seit den Tagen des Laomedon, demtigen wollten. Sinon, ein heldenhafter Grieche, der sich eigens zu diesem Zweck freiwillig gemeldet hatte, machte die Trojaner glauben, es handele sich um ein Weihgeschenk der Griechen an die Gttin Athene, das ihnen, sollten sie es zerstren, Unheil, und, falls sie es in die Stadt brchten, ihren Schutz zuteil kommen lassen wrde. Allein deshalb sei es auch so gro gebaut worden, damit es nicht durch die Stadttore passe. In der Stadt blieben die Warnungen der Kassandra und des Laokoon unbeachtet. Das Pferd wurde in die Stadt gezogen und vor dem Tempel der Athene aufgestellt. In der Nacht krochen die Soldaten aus dem Bauch des Pferdes und ffneten die Stadttore. Die Griechen, die in der Nacht zurckgekehrt waren, drangen in die Stadt ein und zerstrten sie. Dabei kam es zu zahlreichen Freveltaten, die den Griechen auf ihrer Heimreise spter noch schwer zu schaffen machen sollten, wie die Odyssee oder die Mythen um Ajax den Lokrer berichten.</German>

		<Spanish>El caballo de Troya es un artilugio con forma de enorme caballo de madera que se menciona en la historia de la Guerra de Troya y es usado por los griegos como una estrategia para introducirse en la ciudad fortificada de Troya, localizada en la actual Turqu&#237;a. Tomado por los troyanos como un signo de su victoria, el caballo fue llevado dentro de las murallas, sin saber que en su interior se ocultaban varios soldados enemigos. Durante la noche, los guerreros salieron del caballo, mataron a los centinelas y abrieron las puertas de la ciudad para permitir la entrada del ej&#233;rcito griego, lo que provoc&#243; la ca&#237;da definitiva de Troya. La historia de la guerra fue contada por primera vez en la Il&#237;ada de Homero, pero el mencionado caballo no aparece all&#237;, sino, brevemente descrito, en la Odisea, en la que Homero narra el regreso de Odiseo a la isla de &#205;taca. Posteriormente, otros escritores ampliaron el episodio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Por lo general, el caballo de Troya es considerado una creaci&#243;n legendaria, pero tambi&#233;n se ha debatido si realmente pudiera haber existido y fuera una m&#225;quina de guerra transfigurada por la fantas&#237;a de los cronistas. De cualquier manera, demostr&#243; ser un f&#233;rtil motivo tanto literario como art&#237;stico, y desde la Antig&#252;edad ha sido reproducido en innumerables poemas, novelas, pinturas, esculturas, monumentos, pel&#237;culas y otros medios, incluidos dibujos animados y juguetes. Asimismo, en &#233;pocas recientes, se han hecho varias reconstrucciones hipot&#233;ticas del caballo. Aunado a ello, ha dado origen a dos expresiones idiom&#225;ticas: caballo de Troya; es decir, un enga&#241;o destructivo, y presente griego; algo concebido como aparentemente agradable pero que trae consigo graves consecuencias.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La guerra de Troya fue descrita por primera vez en los poemas hom&#233;ricos y desde entonces ha sido contada por otros autores, antiguos y modernos, quienes han introducido variaciones y expandido la historia, pero el resumen del episodio del caballo es el siguiente:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La guerra duraba m&#225;s de nueve a&#241;os cuando el m&#225;s destacado guerrero griego, Aquiles, hab&#237;a ca&#237;do muerto en combate. A pesar de haber cumplido las condiciones impuestas por los or&#225;culos para la toma de la ciudad- traer a Neopt&#243;lemo, hijo de Aquiles; traer los huesos de P&#233;lope y robar el Paladio- los griegos no consegu&#237;an atravesar los muros de Troya.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En esta tesitura, el adivino Calcante observ&#243; una paloma perseguida por un halc&#243;n. La paloma se refugi&#243; en una grieta y el halc&#243;n permanec&#237;a cerca del hueco, pero sin poder atrapar a la paloma. El halc&#243;n entonces decidi&#243; fingir retirarse y se escondi&#243; fuera de la mirada de la paloma, quien poco a poco asom&#243; la cabeza para cerciorarse de que el cazador hab&#237;a desistido pero entonces el halc&#243;n sali&#243; del escondite y culmin&#243; la cacer&#237;a. Despu&#233;s de narrar esta visi&#243;n, Calcante dedujo que no deber&#237;an seguir tratando de asaltar las murallas de Troya por la fuerza, sino que tendr&#237;an que idear una estratagema para tomar la ciudad. Despu&#233;s de ello, Odiseo concibi&#243; el plan de construir un caballo y ocultar dentro a los mejores guerreros. En otras versiones, el plan fue instigado por Atenea y tambi&#233;n existe una tradici&#243;n que se&#241;ala que Prilis, un adivino de la isla de Lesbos, hijo de Hermes, profetiz&#243; que Troya solo podr&#237;a ser tomada con ayuda de un caballo de madera.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bajo las instrucciones de Odiseo o de Atenea, el caballo fue construido por Epeo el feocio, el mejor carpintero del campamento. Ten&#237;a una escotilla escondida en el flanco derecho y en el izquierdo ten&#237;a grabada la frase: Con la agradecida esperanza de un retorno seguro a sus casas despu&#233;s de una ausencia de nueve a&#241;os, los griegos dedican esta ofrenda a Atenea. Los troyanos, grandes creyentes en los dioses, cayeron en el enga&#241;o. Lo aceptaron para ofrendarlo a los dioses, ignorando que era un ardid de los griegos para traspasar sus murallas puesto que en su interior se escond&#237;a un selecto grupo de soldados. El caballo era de tal tama&#241;o que los troyanos tuvieron que derribar parte de los muros de su ciudad. Una vez introducido el caballo en Troya, los soldados ocultos en &#233;l abrieron las puertas de la ciudad, tras lo cual la fuerza invasora entr&#243; y la destruy&#243;.</Spanish>

		<English>Typical construction of wooden defences consisted of small or mid sized tree trunks aligned vertically, with no spacing in between, of variable height. The trunks were sharpened or pointed at the top, and were driven into the ground and were sometimes reinforced with additional construction. The height of a wooden defence ranged from a few feet to nearly ten feet. As a defensive structure they were often used in conjunction with earthworks. These wooden defences were an excellent option for small forts or other hastily constructed fortifications. Since they were wood, they could be quickly and easily built from materials readily available. They proved to be effective protection for short-term conflicts, and were an effective deterrent against small forces. However, due to their wooden construction, they were also vulnerable to fire and siege weapons. Both the Greeks and Romans created palisades to protect their military camps. The Roman historian Livy describes the Greek method as being inferior to that of the Romans during the Second Macedonian War. The Greek stakes were too large to be easily carried, and were spaced too far apart. This made it easy for enemies to uproot them and create a large enough gap in which to enter. In contrast, the Romans used smaller and easier to carry stakes which were placed closer together, making them more difficult to uproot.</English>

		<English>Education in the largest sense is any act or experience that has a formative effect on the mind, character or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated knowledge, skills, and values from one generation to another. Etymologically, the word education is derived from educare (Latin) "bring up", which is related to educere "bring out", "bring forth what is within", "bring out potential" and ducere, "to lead". Teachers in educational institutions direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects, including reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. This process is sometimes called schooling when referring to the education of teaching only a certain subject, usually as professors at institutions of higher learning. There is also education in fields for those who want specific vocational skills, such as those required to be a pilot. In addition there is an array of education possible at the informal level, such as in museums and libraries, with the Internet and in life experience. Many non-traditional education options are now available and continue to evolve. One of the most substantial uses in education is the use of technology. Classrooms of the 21st century contain interactive white boards, iPads, iPods, laptops, etc. Teachers are encouraged to embed these technological devices in the curriculum in order to enhance students learning and meet the needs of various types of learners. The history of education is the history of teaching and learning. Each generation, since the beginning of human existence, has sought to pass on cultural and social values, traditions, morality, religion and skills to the next generation. The passing on of culture is also known as enculturation and the learning of social values and behaviours is socialization. The history of the curricula of such education reflects human history itself, the history of knowledge, beliefs, skills and cultures of humanity. In pre-literate societies, education was achieved orally and through observation and imitation. The young learned informally from their parents, extended family and grand parents. At later stages of their lives, they received instruction of a more structured and formal nature, imparted by people not necessarily related, in the context of initiation, religion or ritual. As the customs and knowledge of ancient civilizations became more complex, many skills would have been learned from an experienced person on the job, in animal husbandry, agriculture, fishing, preparation and preservation of food, construction, stone work, metal work, boat building, the making of weapons and defensis, the military skills and many other occupations. With the development of writing, it became possible for stories, poetry, knowledge, beliefs, and customs to be recorded and passed on more accurately to people out of earshot and to future generations. In many societies, the spread of literacy was slow; orality and illiteracy remained predominant for much of the population for centuries and even millennia. Literacy in preindustrial societies was associated with civil administration, law, long distance trade or commerce, and religion. A formal schooling in literacy was often only available to a small part of the population, either at religious institutions or for the wealthy who could afford to pay for their tutors. The earliest known universities, or places of higher education, started teaching a millennium or more ago. In the city-states of ancient Greece, most education was private, except in Sparta. For example, in Athens, during the 5th and 4th century BC, aside from two years military training, the state played little part in schooling. Anyone could open a school and decide the curriculum. Parents could choose a school offering the subjects they wanted their children to learn, at a monthly fee they could afford. Most parents, even the poor, sent their sons to schools for at least a few years, and if they could afford it from around the age of seven until fourteen, learning gymnastics (including athletics, sport and wrestling), music (including poetry, drama and history) and literacy. Girls rarely received formal education. At writing school, the youngest students learned the alphabet by song, then later by copying the shapes of letters with a stylus on a waxed wooden tablet. After some schooling, the sons of poor or middle class families often learnt a trade by apprenticeship, whether with their father or another tradesman. By around 350 BC, it was common for children at schools in Athens to also study various arts such as drawing, painting, and sculpture. The richest students continued their education by studying with sophists, from whom, they could learn subjects such as rhetoric, mathematics, geography, natural history, politics, and logic. Some of Athens greatest schools of higher education included the Lyceum (the so-called Peripatetic school founded by Aristotle of Stageira) and the Platonic Academy (founded by Plato of Athens). The education system of the wealthy ancient Greeks is also called Paideia. In the subsequent Roman empire, Greek was the primary language of science. Advanced scientific research and teaching was mainly carried on in the Hellenistic side of the Roman empire, in Greek. The education system in the Greek city-state of Sparta was entirely different, designed to create warriors with complete obedience, courage, and physical perfection. At the age of seven, boys were taken away from their homes to live in school dormitories or military barracks. There they were taught sports, endurance and fighting, and little else, with harsh discipline. Most of the population was illiterate. Most of human history lies in prehistory, the period before the use of writing, and before written history. Throughout pre-history, most education was achieved orally and through observation and imitation. The first schools in Ancient Rome arose by the middle of the 4th century BC. These schools were concerned with the basic socialization and rudimentary education of young Roman children. The literacy rate in the 3rd century BC has been estimated as around one percent to two percent. We have very few primary sources or accounts of Roman educational process until the 2nd century BC, during which there was a proliferation of private schools in Rome. At the height of the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire, the Roman educational system gradually found its final form. Formal schools were established, which served paying students (very little in the way of free public education as we know it can be found). Normally, both boys and girls were educated, though not necessarily together. In a system much like the one that predominates in the modern world, the Roman education system that developed arranged schools in tiers. The educator Quintilian recognized the importance of starting education as early as possible, noting that memory not only exists even in small children, but is specially retentive at that age. A Roman student would progress through schools just as a student today might go from elementary school to middle school, then to high school, and finally college. Progression depended more on ability than age with great emphasis being placed upon a students ingenium or inborn gift for learning, and a more tacit emphasis on a students ability to afford high-level education. Only the Roman elite would expect a complete formal education. A tradesman or farmer would expect to pick up most of his vocational skills on the job. Higher education in Rome was more of a status symbol than a practical concern. It has been argued that literacy rates in the Greco-Roman world were seldom more than 20 percent; averaging perhaps not much above 10 percent in the Roman empire, though with wide regional variations, probably never rising above 5 percent in the western provinces, and that the literate in classical Greece did not much exceed 5 percent of the population. Greece did not have a lot of schools.</English>
		<French>Education in the largest sense is any act or experience that has a formative effect on the mind, character or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated knowledge, skills, and values from one generation to another. Etymologically, the word education is derived from educare (Latin) "bring up", which is related to educere "bring out", "bring forth what is within", "bring out potential" and ducere, "to lead". Teachers in educational institutions direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects, including reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. This process is sometimes called schooling when referring to the education of teaching only a certain subject, usually as professors at institutions of higher learning. There is also education in fields for those who want specific vocational skills, such as those required to be a pilot. In addition there is an array of education possible at the informal level, such as in museums and libraries, with the Internet and in life experience. Many non-traditional education options are now available and continue to evolve. One of the most substantial uses in education is the use of technology. Classrooms of the 21st century contain interactive white boards, iPads, iPods, laptops, etc. Teachers are encouraged to embed these technological devices in the curriculum in order to enhance students learning and meet the needs of various types of learners. The history of education is the history of teaching and learning. Each generation, since the beginning of human existence, has sought to pass on cultural and social values, traditions, morality, religion and skills to the next generation. The passing on of culture is also known as enculturation and the learning of social values and behaviours is socialization. The history of the curricula of such education reflects human history itself, the history of knowledge, beliefs, skills and cultures of humanity. In pre-literate societies, education was achieved orally and through observation and imitation. The young learned informally from their parents, extended family and grand parents. At later stages of their lives, they received instruction of a more structured and formal nature, imparted by people not necessarily related, in the context of initiation, religion or ritual. As the customs and knowledge of ancient civilizations became more complex, many skills would have been learned from an experienced person on the job, in animal husbandry, agriculture, fishing, preparation and preservation of food, construction, stone work, metal work, boat building, the making of weapons and defensis, the military skills and many other occupations. With the development of writing, it became possible for stories, poetry, knowledge, beliefs, and customs to be recorded and passed on more accurately to people out of earshot and to future generations. In many societies, the spread of literacy was slow; orality and illiteracy remained predominant for much of the population for centuries and even millennia. Literacy in preindustrial societies was associated with civil administration, law, long distance trade or commerce, and religion. A formal schooling in literacy was often only available to a small part of the population, either at religious institutions or for the wealthy who could afford to pay for their tutors. The earliest known universities, or places of higher education, started teaching a millennium or more ago. In the city-states of ancient Greece, most education was private, except in Sparta. For example, in Athens, during the 5th and 4th century BC, aside from two years military training, the state played little part in schooling. Anyone could open a school and decide the curriculum. Parents could choose a school offering the subjects they wanted their children to learn, at a monthly fee they could afford.

		<English>As fortune telling, divination, or divination, pejoratively divination, in the cultural history, summarized in anthropology and in the New Age many practices and methods that are intended to predict future events or to obtain otherwise hidden knowledge that the sensory perceptions is not accessible. The spectrum of practices ranging from the interpretation of random events according to predetermined rules to the use of so-called clairvoyant abilities. Common examples are the hand-reading, card reading and astrology. Divination is historically found in all societies and eras, from which there is absolutely written documents. According to the oldest written documents that were found in the Middle East, it was at that time to a fundamental social role. In the 3rd millennium BC is already a wealth of relevant practices mentioned, including the Lekanomantie (divination by means of oil), Teratomantie (predictions based on birth defects) and the Oniromantie (interpretation Warns of rooms). The most sophisticated technology was then the Haruspizium, the prediction based on the consideration of the entrails of slaughtered sacrificial animals specifically. From the outset, only divine essence, a knowledge of the future was attributed. The gods, it was thought, but sends characters, that interpretation would allow the people to glimpse the future at least. The specialists of the discipline makes a record of semantic relationships between observed events, evaluates them and gathered all in an increasingly complex knowledge. In Palestine was the fortune-telling in the 2nd millennium BC is very widespread, as evidenced by modern exegesis of many passages in the Old Testament. And that applies to the Hebrews as well as for the other Balkan peoples. It was not until the turn of the last millennium BC, the religious authors attempted to exterminate the soothsayers or distribute, but which had only moderate success, despite considerable efforts. Of great importance was the fortune-telling even when the Germans and the Celts, who used also a variety of methods, including the prediction of animal noises or the flight of birds. The Celts were the specialists of the divination, the Druids, a considerable influence on policy, in which they sometimes even actively interfered. Another form of divination, which was already in the Archaic period known to all nations, is the prophecy. Prophets proclaim the words of gods and are therefore not counted among the soothsayers to interpret what the outward signs. In ancient Greece, the divination was originally seen as a gift, the chosen person is granted by the gods. Later, the fortune-telling to a learnable science was developed in which (if survives) were common to the 230 different methods. A preferred place to incorporate those dream interpretation (Oniromantie) because, dreams were seen as direct divine communications which are often allegorically, however, and therefore needed an interpretation. The belief in that meaning of dreams was commonplace, even among the biggest skeptics few doubted. Another specialty of the ancient Greeks had an intuitive or inspired by the special form of divination oracle. were looked after, unlike the Greeks, the Latins, only the present and the immediate future, and with regard to the latter cause was not for knowledge, but to the purely practical question of how to insure themselves for their projects to the good will of the gods . Among them were a few prophets and seers, and very few oracles. It was not primarily interested in bringing the views of the gods in experience, but it if necessary to influence. Even if the gods by drastic signs such as solar eclipses and flashes appeared out of nowhere expressed their anger to express, tried by the Romans not to interpret this, but focused on the related to the situation corresponding atonement ceremony (procuratio) and through this the divine cancel anger-a process of rigorous legal and liability involved for the god. Therefore, the divination in ancient Rome has traditionally had a magical character and ran out to turn off the gods and to let the people alone to decide on its future. Following contact with the Greek oracles spread also among the Romans an interest in the real prophecy. Acquired a special meaning here the Haruspizes (specialists of the entrails) among the neighboring Etruscans, traditionally held in the past occasionally consulted, but was generally viewed with suspicion. Now was not long before every rich and powerful Romans his own Haruspex, where was preserved the basic magical alignment. Since lapsed into Etruria even the once highly developed art of prophecy after the integration into the Roman Empire, which Haruspizium finally stood at the service of the Roman aristocracy, while the people discovered the many new divination from the conquered territories for themselves. With the conversion of the first emperor to Christianity, eventually had no choice, the Christian prophecy, the direct inspiration of the one God, the only legitimate view of the future, everything else has now been condemned as superstition and fraud. Because of this view, the purely earthly future had no meaning and this world would be anyway not for long, shifted the focus of announcements of political and military events in such a global, even cosmic proportions: the Antichrist, the return of Christ and the end the world.

		<German>Als Wahrsagen, Wahrsagung oder Mantik, abwertend Wahrsagerei, werden in der Kulturgeschichte, in der Ethnologie und in der Esoterik zahlreiche Praktiken und Methoden zusammengefasst, die dazu dienen sollen, zuk&#252;nftige Ereignisse vorherzusagen oder anderweitig verborgenes Wissen zu erlangen, das den Sinneswahrnehmungen nicht zug&#228;nglich ist. Das Spektrum dieser Praktiken reicht von der Deutung zuf&#228;lliger Ereignisse nach vorgegebenen Regeln bis zur Inanspruchnahme so genannter hellseherischer F&#228;higkeiten. Verbreitete Beispiele sind das Handlesen, das Kartenlegen und die Astrologie. Wahrsagen ist historisch in allen Gesellschaften und Zeitaltern nachgewiesen, aus denen es &#252;berhaupt Schriftzeugnisse gibt. Nach den &#228;ltesten schriftlichen Dokumenten, die man im Nahen Osten fand, kam ihm in jener Zeit eine grundlegende soziale Rolle zu. Im 3. vorchristlichen Jahrtausend wird bereits eine F&#252;lle einschl&#228;giger Praktiken genannt, darunter die Lekanomantie (Weissagung mittels &#214;ls), Teratomantie (Vorhersagen anhand von Missbildungen) und die Oniromantie (Deutung von Warntr&#228;umen). Die ausgefeilteste Technik war damals das Haruspizium, die Vorhersage anhand der Betrachtung der Eingeweide speziell daf&#252;r geschlachteter Opfertiere. Von Anfang an wurde dabei nur g&#246;ttlichen Wesen eine Kenntnis der Zukunft zugeschrieben. Die G&#246;tter, so meinte man, sendeten aber Zeichen, deren Deutung es dem Menschen erlaubte, die Zukunft immerhin zu erahnen. Die Spezialisten der mantischen Disziplinen machten Aufzeichnungen &#252;ber beobachtete Zusammenh&#228;nge von Ereignissen, werteten diese aus und sammelten so ein immer komplexeres Wissen an. In Pal&#228;stina war das Wahrsagen im 2. vorchristlichen Jahrtausend sehr verbreitet, wie nach der modernen Exegese zahlreiche Stellen im Alten Testament belegen. Und das gilt f&#252;r die Hebr&#228;er ebenso wie f&#252;r die anderen dortigen V&#246;lker. Erst ab der Wende zum letzten vorchristlichen Jahrtausend versuchten die religi&#246;sen Autoren, die Wahrsager auszurotten oder zu vertreiben, was aber trotz erheblicher Anstrengungen nur m&#228;&#223;igen Erfolg hatte. Von gro&#223;er Bedeutung war das Wahrsagen auch bei den Germanen und bei den Kelten, die ebenfalls vielf&#228;ltige Verfahren anwendeten, darunter die Weissagung aus Tierstimmen oder aus dem Flug der V&#246;gel. Bei den Kelten hatten die Spezialisten des Wahrsagens, die Druiden, erheblichen Einfluss auf die Politik, in die sie sich mitunter sogar aktiv einmischten. Eine weitere Form der Weissagung, die schon in archaischer Zeit bei allen V&#246;lkern bekannt war, ist die Prophetie. Propheten verk&#252;nden die Worte von G&#246;ttern und werden daher nicht zu den Wahrsagern gerechnet, welche &#228;u&#223;ere Zeichen deuten. Im antiken Griechenland wurde das Wahrsagen urspr&#252;nglich als eine Gabe betrachtet, die auserw&#228;hlten Personen durch die G&#246;tter verliehen wird. Sp&#228;ter wurde das Wahrsagen zu einer erlernbaren Wissenschaft entwickelt, in der (soweit &#252;berliefert) an die 230 verschiedene Methoden gebr&#228;uchlich waren. Einen bevorzugten Platz nahm dabei die Traumdeutung (Oniromantie) ein, weil Tr&#228;ume als unmittelbare g&#246;ttliche Mitteilungen angesehen wurden, die allerdings vielfach allegorisch seien und daher einer Auslegung bedurften. Der Glaube an diese Bedeutung der Tr&#228;ume war allgemein verbreitet; selbst unter den gr&#246;&#223;ten Skeptikern zweifelten nur wenige daran. Eine weitere Spezialit&#228;t der alten Griechen war die intuitive oder inspirierte Divination mit der Sonderform des Orakels. Im Unterschied zu den Griechen k&#252;mmerten sich die Latiner nur um die Gegenwart und die unmittelbare Zukunft, und im Hinblick auf letztere ging es ihnen nicht um Erkenntnis, sondern um die rein praktische Frage, wie sie sich f&#252;r ihre Vorhaben des guten Willens der G&#246;tter versichern konnten. Es gab unter ihnen nur wenige Propheten und Seher und sehr wenige Orakel. Man war nicht prim&#228;r daran interessiert, die Meinung der G&#246;tter in Erfahrung zu bringen, sondern diese, wenn n&#246;tig, zu beeinflussen. Selbst wenn die G&#246;tter durch drastische Vorzeichen wie Sonnenfinsternisse oder Blitze aus heiterem Himmel offenbar ihren Zorn zum Ausdruck brachten, versuchten die R&#246;mer nicht, diese zu deuten, sondern konzentrierten sich darauf, die der Situation entsprechende S&#252;hnezeremonie (procuratio) zu finden und durch diese den g&#246;ttlichen Zorn zu annullieren. Ein Vorgang von juristischer Strenge und Verbindlichkeit, auch f&#252;r den beteiligten Gott. Daher hatte das Wahrsagen im antiken Rom traditionell einen magischen Charakter und lief darauf hinaus, die G&#246;tter auszuschalten und den Menschen allein &#252;ber seine Zukunft entscheiden zu lassen. Nach dem Kontakt mit den griechischen Orakeln verbreitete sich jedoch auch unter den R&#246;mern ein Interesse an der wirklichen Weissagung. Eine besondere Bedeutung erlangten dabei die Haruspizes (Spezialisten der Eingeweideschau) unter den benachbarten Etruskern, die man schon in fr&#252;heren Zeiten gelegentlich zu Rate gezogen, aber grunds&#228;tzlich mit Argwohn betrachtet hatte. Nun hielt sich bald jeder reiche und m&#228;chtige R&#246;mer seinen eigenen Haruspex, wobei jedoch die prinzipielle magische Ausrichtung erhalten blieb. Da in Etrurien selbst die einst hochentwickelte Wahrsagekunst nach der Eingliederung in das r&#246;mische Reich verfiel, stand das Haruspizium schlie&#223;lich ganz in den Diensten der r&#246;mischen Aristokratie, w&#228;hrend das Volk die zahlreichen neuen Divinationsmethoden aus den eroberten Gebieten f&#252;r sich entdeckte. Mit der Bekehrung der ersten Kaiser zum Christentum blieb schlie&#223;lich die christliche Prophetie, die direkte Inspiration durch den einen Gott, als einzige legitime Sicht der Zukunft &#252;brig; alles andere wurde nun als Aberglaube und Betrug verdammt. Da aus dieser Sicht die rein irdische Zukunft keine Bedeutung mehr hatte und diese Welt ohnehin nicht mehr lange bestehen w&#252;rde, verschob sich der Schwerpunkt der Ank&#252;ndigungen von politischen und milit&#228;rischen Ereignissen auf solche globalen, ja kosmischen Ausma&#223;es: den Antichrist, die Wiederkehr Christi und das Ende der Welt. Vor diesem Hintergrund nahm der Kampf gegen weltliches Wahrsagen (an deren Wirksamkeit auch die ersten christlichen Kaiser durchaus noch glaubten) eine neue Dimension an: sie geh&#246;rte nun zu den Resten heidnischen Aberglaubens, die es auszurotten galt.</German>
		<Italian>As fortune telling, divination, or divination, pejoratively divination, in the cultural history, summarized in anthropology and in the New Age many practices and methods that are intended to predict future events or to obtain otherwise hidden knowledge that the sensory perceptions is not accessible. The spectrum of practices ranging from the interpretation of random events according to predetermined rules to the use of so-called clairvoyant abilities. Common examples are the hand-reading, card reading and astrology. Divination is historically found in all societies and eras, from which there is absolutely written documents. According to the oldest written documents that were found in the Middle East, it was at that time to a fundamental social role. In the 3rd millennium BC is already a wealth of relevant practices mentioned, including the Lekanomantie (divination by means of oil), Teratomantie (predictions based on birth defects) and the Oniromantie (interpretation Warns of rooms). The most sophisticated technology was then the Haruspizium, the prediction based on the consideration of the entrails of slaughtered sacrificial animals specifically. From the outset, only divine essence, a knowledge of the future was attributed. The gods, it was thought, but sends characters, that interpretation would allow the people to glimpse the future at least. The specialists of the discipline makes a record of semantic relationships between observed events, evaluates them and gathered all in an increasingly complex knowledge. In Palestine was the fortune-telling in the 2nd millennium BC is very widespread, as evidenced by modern exegesis of many passages in the Old Testament. And that applies to the Hebrews as well as for the other Balkan peoples. It was not until the turn of the last millennium BC, the religious authors attempted to exterminate the soothsayers or distribute, but which had only moderate success, despite considerable efforts. Of great importance was the fortune-telling even when the Germans and the Celts, who used also a variety of methods, including the prediction of animal noises or the flight of birds. The Celts were the specialists of the divination, the Druids, a considerable influence on policy, in which they sometimes even actively interfered. Another form of divination, which was already in the Archaic period known to all nations, is the prophecy. Prophets proclaim the words of gods and are therefore not counted among the soothsayers to interpret what the outward signs. In ancient Greece, the divination was originally seen as a gift, the chosen person is granted by the gods. Later, the fortune-telling to a learnable science was developed in which (if survives) were common to the 230 different methods. A preferred place to incorporate those dream interpretation (Oniromantie) because, dreams were seen as direct divine communications which are often allegorically, however, and therefore needed an interpretation. The belief in that meaning of dreams was commonplace, even among the biggest skeptics few doubted. Another specialty of the ancient Greeks had an intuitive or inspired by the special form of divination oracle. were looked after, unlike the Greeks, the Latins, only the present and the immediate future, and with regard to the latter cause was not for knowledge, but to the purely practical question of how to insure themselves for their projects to the good will of the gods . Among them were a few prophets and seers, and very few oracles. It was not primarily interested in bringing the views of the gods in experience, but it if necessary to influence. Even if the gods by drastic signs such as solar eclipses and flashes appeared out of nowhere expressed their anger to express, tried by the Romans not to interpret this, but focused on the related to the situation corresponding atonement ceremony (procuratio) and through this the divine cancel anger-a process of rigorous legal and liability involved for the god. Therefore, the divination in ancient Rome has traditionally had a magical character and ran out to turn off the gods and to let the people alone to decide on its future. Following contact with the Greek oracles spread also among the Romans an interest in the real prophecy. Acquired a special meaning here the Haruspizes (specialists of the entrails) among the neighboring Etruscans, traditionally held in the past occasionally consulted, but was generally viewed with suspicion. Now was not long before every rich and powerful Romans his own Haruspex, where was preserved the basic magical alignment. Since lapsed into Etruria even the once highly developed art of prophecy after the integration into the Roman Empire, which Haruspizium finally stood at the service of the Roman aristocracy, while the people discovered the many new divination from the conquered territories for themselves. With the conversion of the first emperor to Christianity, eventually had no choice, the Christian prophecy, the direct inspiration of the one God, the only legitimate view of the future, everything else has now been condemned as superstition and fraud. Because of this view, the purely earthly future had no meaning and this world would be anyway not for long, shifted the focus of announcements of political and military events in such a global, even cosmic proportions: the Antichrist, the return of Christ and the end the world. Against this background, the fight was against "secular" fortune-telling (on the effectiveness of the first Christian emperor definitely still believed) to a new dimension: it now belonged to the remains of heathen superstition, was to eradicate it.</Italian>

		<English>A horse archer, horsed archer, or mounted archer is a cavalryman armed with a bow, able to shoot while riding from horseback. Archery has occasionally been used from the backs of other riding animals. Mounted archery was a defining characteristic of Steppe warfare throughout Central Asia, and throughout the prairies of America after the adoption of the horse, used by peoples including the Scythians, Sarmatians, Parthians, Sassanids, Huns, Byzantines, Bulgars, Cumans, Kipchaks, Magyars, Japanese, Mongols, Turks, Rajputs, Comanches, and others. It was also adopted by other peoples and armies, notably Chinese and Romans who both suffered serious conflict with peoples practising horse archery. It developed separately among the peoples of the South American pampas and the North American prairies; the Comanches were especially skilled. Horse archery was also particularly honoured in the samurai tradition of Japan, where mounted archery is called Yabusame. In some places, such as in Germany, Scandinavia and Portugal, the crossbow was favoured over composite bow. Horse archery was never widely used south of the Sahara in Africa, where the ecosystem was less suitable for domestic horses. This was presumably due to factors such as the tsetse fly and lack of suitable fodder. Though some African kingdoms south of the Sahara used horses, they were less useful and had a high mortality rate in these regions. Early horse archery, depicted on the Assyrian carvings, involved two riders, one controlling both horses while the second shot. One of the few commanders who won his first battle against horse archers was Alexander the Great. He defeated Scythians in 329 BCE at the Battle of Jaxartes (the Syr Darya river). Even so, the Jaxartes marked the north-easternmost border of Alexanders realm in Asia, and he never ventured beyond into the heartlands of the horse nomads. Other commanders of heavy troops with few or no archers of their own had often disastrous experiences, including Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae. The medieval Battle of Liegnitz is a classic example of horse archers contributing to the defeat of armoured troops, via demoralization and continued harassment. Skirmishing requires vast areas of free space to run, manoeuvre and flee, and if the terrain is close, light horse archers can be charged and defeated easily. Light horse archers are also very vulnerable to foot archers and crossbowmen, who easily can outshoot them by shooting on volleys.</English>

		<German>In den Steppenregionen Zentralasiens begannen Nomadenv&#246;lker im 1. Jahrtausend v. Chr. mit der gezielten Nutzung des Pferdes als Reit- und Arbeitstier (auch zur Ern&#228;hrung).

In den n&#228;chsten 2.500 Jahren beherrschten mobile Reiterv&#246;lker den gesamten innerasiatischen Raum, auch mit milit&#228;rischen Mitteln: Sie stahlen Pferde, &#252;berfielen ihre Nachbarn und begr&#252;ndeten das offensive Reiterkriegertum.

		<English>Heliocentrism (or heliocentricism), is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a stationary Sun at the center of the solar system. The word comes from the Greek helios (sun) and kentron(center). Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but had received no support from most other ancient astronomers. The first non-geocentric model of the Universe was proposed by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus (d. 390 BC). According to Philolaus, at the center of the Universe was a "central fire" around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion. This system postulated the existence of a counter-earth collinear with the Earth and central fire, with the same period of revolution around the central fire as the Earth. The Sun revolved around the central fire once a year, and the stars were stationary. The Earth maintained the same hidden face towards the central fire, rendering both it and the "counter-earth" invisible from Earth. The Pythagorean concept of uniform circular motion remained unchallenged for approximately the next 2000 years, and it was to the Pythagoreans that Copernicus referred to show that the notion of a moving Earth was neither new nor revolutionary. Heraclides of Pontus (4th century BC) explained the apparent daily motion of the celestial sphere through the rotation of the Earth. It used to be thought that he believed Mercury and Venus to revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around the Earth. Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius (395423 AD) later described this as the "Egyptian System," stating that "it did not escape the skill of the Egyptians," though there is no other evidence it was known in ancient Egypt. The first person known to have proposed a heliocentric system, however, was Aristarchus of Samos (c. 270 BC). Like Eratosthenes, Aristarchus calculated the size of the Earth, and measured the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, in a treatise which has survived. From his estimates, he concluded that the Sun was six to seven times wider than the Earth and thus hundreds of times more voluminous. His writings on the heliocentric system are lost, but some information is known from surviving descriptions and critical commentary by his contemporaries, such as Archimedes. Some have suggested that his calculation of the relative size of the Earth and Sun led Aristarchus to conclude that it made more sense for the Earth to be moving than for the huge Sun to be moving around it. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes book The Sand Reckoner describes another work by Aristarchus in which he advanced an alternative hypothesis of the heliocentric model. It should be noted that since Plutarch mentions the followers of Aristarchus in passing, there were likely other astronomers in the Classical period who also espoused heliocentrism, but whose work is now lost to us. The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who is known to have supported Aristarchus heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BC), a hellenized Babylonian astronomer who flourished a century after Aristarchus in the Seleucid empire. Seleucus adopted the heliocentric system of Aristarchus and is said to have proved the heliocentric theory. According to Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a geometric model for the heliocentric theory and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model. He may have used early trigonometric methods that were available in his time, as he was a contemporary of Hipparchus. A fragment of a work by Seleucus of Seleucia, who supported Aristarchus heliocentric model in the 2nd century BC, has survived in Arabic translation, which was referred to by Rhazes.</English>

The most skillfull Illyrian sailors were the Liburnians, Japodes, Delmatae and Ardaei. The greastest navy was built by Agron in the 3rd century BC. The Illyrian tactics consisted of lashing their galleys together in groups of four and inviting a broadside attack from a ram. The Illyrians would then board the enemy craft in overwhelming numbers. Illyrian war ships were adopted by many peoples especially the Greeks and Romans. Illyrian craftsmen were even hired by the King of Macedon to build 100 ships in the First Macedonian War because to him they bore a special gift of ship building. The earliest evidence of Illyrian ships is from the design of a ship incised on bronze greaves from Glasinac dating from the 8th century BC to the 7th century BC. The front of this ship is constructed in the form of an animal probably an horse. The Illyrians were often referred to a pirates, raiding Greek and Roman vessels.

		<English>Glassblowing is a glass forming technique which was invented by the Phoenicians at approximately 50 BC somewhere along the Syro-Palestinian coast. The earliest evidence of glassblowing comes from a collection of waste from a glass workshop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a mikvah, a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of Old City of Jerusalem dated from 37 to 4 BC Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form small bottle, thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe. Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of glass. Such invention swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as casting and core-forming, in working glass. The invention of glassblowing coincided with the establishment of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC which served to provide motivation to its spread and dominance. Glassblowing was greatly encouraged under the Roman rule, although Roman citizens could not be "in trade", in particular under the reign of Augustus, therefore glass was being blown in many areas of the Roman world. On the eastern borders of the Empire, the first glass workshops were set up by the Phoenicians in the birthplace of glassblowing in contemporary Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine, as well as in the neighbouring province of Cyprus. Ennion for example, was among one of the most prominent glassworkers from Lebanon of the time. He was renowned for producing the multi-paneled mould-blown glass vessels that were complex in their shapes, arrangement and decorative motifs. The complexity of designs of these mould-blown glass vessels illustrated that the sophistication of the glassworkers in the eastern regions of the Roman Empire. Mould-blown glass vessels manufactured by the workshops of Ennion and other contemporary glassworkers such as Jason, Nikon, Aristeas and Meges, constitutes some of the earliest evidence of glassblowing found in the eastern territories. Meanwhile, the glassblowing technique reached Egypt and was described in a fragmentary poem printed on the papyrus which was dated to 3rd century AD. Besides, the Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of Hellenistic casting, core-forming and mosaic fusion techniques by blowing. The earliest evidence of blowing in Hellenistic consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved from the glass workshops on the Greek island of Samothrace and at Corinth in mainland Greece which were dated to 1st century AD. On the other hand, the Phoenician glassworkers exploited their glassblowing techniques and set up their workshops in the western territories of the Roman Empire first in Italy by the middle of the 1st century AD Rome, the heartland of the Empire, soon became a major glassblowing centre and more glassblowing workshops were subsequently established in other provinces of Italy, for example Campania, Morgantina and Aquileia. A great variety of blown glass objects, ranging from unguentaria (toiletry container for perfume) to cameo, from tableware to window glass, were produced.</English>

		<English>The Maccabees (Hebrew: Makabim or Maqabim) were a Jewish rebel army who took control of Judea, which had been a client state of the Seleucid Empire. They founded the Hasmonean dynasty, which ruled from 164 BCE to 63 BCE, reasserting the Jewish religion, expanding the boundaries of the Land of Israel and reducing the influence of Hellenism. In the 2nd century BCE, Judea lay between the Ptolemaic Kingdom based in Egypt and the Seleucid empire based in Syria, kingdoms formed after the death of Alexander the Great (336323 BCE). Previously under the Ptolemies, Judea had fallen to the Seleucids in ca.200 BCE. Since the rule of Alexander in the near east, there had been a process of Hellenization, which affected Judea. Some Jews, mainly those of the urban upper class, notably the Tobiad family, wished to dispense with Jewish law and to adopt a Greek lifestyle. According to the historian Victor Tcherikover, the main motive for the Tobiads Hellenism was economic and political. Hellenizing Jews had built a gymnasium, competed internationally in Greek games, "removed their marks of circumcision and repudiated the holy covenant". When Antiochus IV Epiphanes (ca. 215164 BCE), became ruler of the Seleucid Empire in 175 BCE, the High Priest in Jerusalem was Onias III. Antiochus was insensitive to the views of religious Jews and treated the High Priest as a political appointee and one from whom money could be made. To Antiochus, the High Priest was merely a local governor within his realm, who could be appointed or dismissed at will, while to orthodox Jews he was divinely appointed. Jason, the brother of Onias, bribed Antiochus to make him High Priest instead. Jason abolished the traditional theocracy and constituted Jerusalem as a Greek polis. Menelaus (who was not even a member of the Levite priestly family) then bribed Antiochus and was appointed High Priest in place of Jason. Menelaus had Onias assassinated. His brother Lysimachus took holy vessels from the Temple, causing riots and the thiefs death at the hands of the rioters. Menelaus was arrested and arraigned before Antiochus, but he bribed his way out of trouble. Jason subsequently drove out Menelaus and became High Priest again. Antiochus pillaged the Temple, attacked Jerusalem and "led captive the women and children". From this point onwards, Antiochus pursued a Hellenizing policy with zeal. This effectively meant banning traditional Jewish religious practice. In 167 BCE Jewish sacrifice was forbidden, sabbaths and feasts were banned and circumcision was outlawed. Altars to Greek gods were set up and animals prohibited to Jews were sacrificed on them. The Olympian Zeus was placed on the altar of the Temple. Possession of Jewish scriptures was made a capital offence. The motives of Antiochus are unclear. He may have been incensed at the overthrow of his appointee, Menelaus, or he may have been responding to an orthodox Jewish revolt that drew on the Temple and the Torah for its strength and encouraged by a group of radical Hellenizers among the Jews. In the narrative of I Maccabees, after Antiochus issued his decrees forbidding Jewish religious practice, a rural Jewish priest from Modiin, Mattathias the Hasmonean, sparked the revolt against the Seleucid Empire by refusing to worship the Greek gods. Mattathias killed a Hellenistic Jew who stepped forward to offer a sacrifice to an idol in Mattathias place. He and his five sons fled to the wilderness of Judah. After Mattathias death about one year later in 166 BCE, his son Judah Maccabee led an army of Jewish dissidents to victory over the Seleucid dynasty in guerrilla warfare, which at first was directed against Hellenizing Jews, of whom there were many. The Maccabees destroyed pagan altars in the villages, circumcised children and forced Jews into outlawry. The term Maccabees as used to describe the Jewish army is taken from the Hebrew word for "hammer". The revolt itself involved many battles, in which the Maccabean forces gained notoriety among the Syrian army for their use of guerrilla tactics. After the victory, the Maccabees entered Jerusalem in triumph and ritually cleansed the Temple, reestablishing traditional Jewish worship there and installing Jonathan Maccabee as high priest. A large Syrian army was sent to quash the revolt, but returned to Syria on the death of Antiochus IV. Its commander Lysias, preoccupied with internal Syrian affairs, agreed to a political compromise that restored religious freedom. The Jewish festival of Hanukkah celebrates the re-dedication of the Temple following Judah Maccabees victory over the Seleucids. According to Rabbinic tradition, the victorious Maccabees could only find a small jug of oil that had remained uncontaminated by virtue of a seal, and although it only contained enough oil to sustain the Menorah for one day, it miraculously lasted for eight days, by which time further oil could be procured.</English>

		<English>In boat building, carvel built or carvel planking is a method of constructing wooden boats and tall ships by fixing planks to a frame so that the planks butt up against each other, edge to edge, gaining support from the frame and forming a smooth hull. Such planking requires caulking between the joints over and above that needed by the clinker built technology, but gives a stronger hull capable of taking a variety of full-rigged sail plans, albeit one of greater weight. On the up side, Carvel built construction enables greater length and breadth of hull as well as superior sail rigs because of its strong framing, and is the most critical development that enabled the centuries long dominance of the powers of Western Europe in the Age of Sail and beyond. In western knowledge and culture, carvel construction originated in the Carrack and Caravel ships of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the two types of ship both being invented in Iberia from which they were first sailed by the kingdoms of Portugal and Spain in the early trans-oceanic voyages of the Age of Exploration. At the same time as their appearance, the centuries-long battles to expel the Muslims from Iberia were gradually swinging to the Christian side, represented by the Kingdom of Aragon and the Kingdom of Castile, which were not united into Spain until the time of Christopher Columbus. Their invention is generally credited to the Portuguese people, who first explored south along the coast of Africa searching for a trade route to the far east in order to avoid the costly middlemen of the Eastern Mediterranean civilizations who sat upon the routes of the spice trade. Spices, in the era, were expensive luxuries and were used medicinally.</English>

		<English>The term monarchy (old Greek: sole rule) describes a form of government with one person, the monarch, who holds the office of head of state for life or until his abdication. The monarchy thus forms the counterpart to the modern concept of republic. As a rule, the office is transferred from the circle of noble people through inheritance or election.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In a hereditary monarchy, the ruler is determined by succession, in the latter by an election, usually for life. In hereditary monarchies, the head of state's claim to rule is usually traced back to a divine determination (pharaoh, god-king).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The electoral monarchy (with often a limited number of candidates and voters) seems to be historically older than the hereditary monarchy, which successfully reduced the risk of civil war in the succession. In Europe, until Christianization, there was usually some form of elective monarchy. Both Germanic and Celtic tribes chose their chiefs, but these usually came from powerful and influential family clans. In the Middle Ages, Europe was increasingly ruled by hereditary monarchies.</English>

La monarchie forme ainsi la contrepartie du concept moderne de r&#233;publique.

		<Italian>Il termine monarchia (antica regola greca unica) descrive una forma di governo con una persona, il monarca, che ricopre la carica di capo di stato a vita o fino alla sua abdicazione.

Nelle monarchie ereditarie, la pretesa di governo del capo dello stato viene solitamente fatta risalire a una determinazione divina (faraone, dio-re).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La monarchia elettorale (con spesso un numero limitato di candidati ed elettori) sembra storicamente pi&#249; antica della monarchia ereditaria, che ha ridotto con successo il rischio di guerra civile nella successione. In Europa, fino alla cristianizzazione, di solito c'era una qualche forma di monarchia elettiva. Sia le trib&#249; germaniche che quelle celtiche scelsero i loro capi, ma questi di solito provenivano da clan familiari potenti e influenti. Nel Medioevo, l'Europa era sempre pi&#249; governata da monarchie ereditarie.</Italian>

		<English>Diarchy (or dyarchy) is a form of government in which two individuals, the diarchs, are the heads of state. In most diarchies, the diarchs hold their position for life and pass the responsibilities and power of the position to their children or family when they die. Diarchy is one of the oldest forms of government. Diarchies are known from ancient Sparta, Rome, Carthage as well as from Germanic and Dacian tribes. Several ancient Polynesian societies exhibited a diarchic political structure as well. Ranks in the Inca Empire were structured in moieties, with two occupants of each rank, but with different prestige, one hanan (upper) and one hurin (lower). In modern usage diarchy means a system of dual rule, whether this be of a government or of an organization. Such diarchies are not hereditary.</English>

		<English>In classical politics, a tyrant (Greek, tyrannos) is one who illegally seizes and controls a governmental power in a polis. Tyrants were a group of individuals who took over many Greek poleis during the uprising of the middle classes in the sixth and seventh centuries BC, ousting the aristocratic governments. Plato and Aristotle define a tyrant as, "one who rules without law, looks to his own advantage rather than that of his subjects, and uses extreme and cruel tactics -- against his own people as well as others". During the sixth and seventh centuries BC, tyranny was often looked upon as an intermediate stage between narrow oligarchy and more democratic forms of polity. However, in the late fifth and fourth centuries, a new kind of tyrant, the military dictator arose, specifically in Sicily. In ancient Greece, tyrants were influential opportunists that came to power by securing the support of different factions of a deme. The word "tyrannos", possibly pre-Greek, Pelasgian or eastern in origin, then carried no ethical censure; it simply referred to anyone, good or bad, who obtained executive power in a polis by unconventional means. Support for the tyrants came from the growing middle class and from the peasants who had no land or were in debt to the wealthy land owners. It is true that they had no legal right to rule, but the people preferred them over kings or the aristocracy. The Greek tyrants stayed in power by using mercenary soldiers from outside of their respective city-state. To mock tyranny, Thales wrote that the strangest thing to see is "an aged tyrant" meaning that tyrants do not have the public support to survive for long. In Corinth, growing wealth from colonial enterprises, and the wider horizons brought about by the export of wine and oil, together with the new experiences of the Eastern Mediterranean brought back by returning mercenary hoplites employed overseas allowed Cypselus, the first tyrant of Corinth in the 7th century BC, to overthrow the aristocratic power of the dominant but unpopular Bacchiadae, who were killed, executed, driven out and exiled in 657 BC. Corinth prospered economically under his rule and Cypselus manages to rule without a bodyguard but when he managed to bequeath his position to his son, Periander, whose position was less secure, his son required a bodyguard of mercenary soldiers personally loyal to himself. Nevertheless, under Cypselus and Periander, Corinth extended and tightened her control over her colonial enterprises, and exports of Corinthian pottery flourished. However, tyrants seldom succeeded in establishing an untroubled line of succession. Perianders successor was less fortunate and was expelled, Corinth was ruled by a lack-lustre oligarchy, and was exclipsed by the rising powers of Athens and Sparta. In Athens, the inhabitants first gave the title of tyrant to Peisistratus, a relative of Solon, the Athenian lawgiver, who succeeded in 546 BC, after 2 failed attempts, to install himself as tyrant. Supported by prosperity of the pesantry and landowning interests of the plain (prospering from the rise of olive exports), and his clients from Marathon, he managed to achieve supreme power. Through an ambitious program of public works, by fostering the state cult of Athena, by encouraging the creation of festivals and supporting the Panathenaean games, in which prizes were jars of olive oil, and in his support of the Dionosia (leading to the development of Athenian drama) Peisistratus managed to maintain his personal popularity. He was followed by his sons, and with the subsequent growth of Athenian democracy, the title "tyrant" took on its familiar negative connotations. The murder of his son, the tyrant Hipparchus by Aristogeiton and Harmodios in Athens in 514 BC marked the beginning of the so-called "cult of the tyrannicides" (i.e., of killers of tyrants). Contempt for tyranny characterised this cult movement. Despite financial help from Persia, in 510 the Peisistratids were expelled by a combination of intrigue, exile and Spartan arms. The anti-tyrannical attitude became especially prevalent in Athens after 508 BC, when Cleisthenes reformed the political system so that it resembled demokratia (ancient participant democracy as opposed to the modern representative democracy).</English>

Chr. aufkam und vor allem au&#223;erhalb des griechischen Mutterlandes (vor allem auf Sizilien) verbreitet war. Im Gegensatz zur Basileia (K&#246;nigtum) bezeichnete der Begriff Tyrannis dabei in der Regel eine illegitime Form der Alleinherrschaft &#252;ber eine Polis, in der eine monarchische Staatsform eigentlich nicht vorgesehen und mit den nomoi (Gesetzen) schwer oder gar nicht vereinbar war.</German>

		<Spanish>La tiran&#237;a (del griego tyrannos), en el sentido que se dio al t&#233;rmino en la Grecia antigua, era el r&#233;gimen de poder absoluto, de ordinario unipersonal, que con frecuencia instauraba el tirano, aquel o aquellos que hab&#237;an derrocado el gobierno de una ciudad-estado, normalmente gracias al apoyo popular, pero tambi&#233;n mediante un golpe de estado militar o una intervenci&#243;n extranjera.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Parece que el t&#233;rmino "tirano" se aplic&#243; por primera vez a Fid&#243;n de Argos y a C&#237;pselo de Corinto.

		<English>The Concilium Plebis-known in English as the Plebeian Council or Peoples Assembly-was the principal popular assembly of the ancient Roman Republic. It functioned as a legislative assembly, through which the plebeians (commoners) could pass laws, elect magistrates, and try judicial cases. The Plebeian Council was originally organized on the basis of the Curia. Thus, it was originally a "Plebeian Curiate Assembly". Around the year 471 BC, it was reorganized on the basis of the Tribes. Thus, it became a "Plebeian Tribal Assembly". The Plebeian Council usually met in the well of the Comitia. Often patrician senators would observe from the steps of the Curia Hostilia, and would sometimes heckle during meetings. The representatives of the Plebians in government are called Tribunes. These Tribunes had the power to veto the laws of the Senate. When the Roman Republic was founded in 509 BC, the Roman people were organized on the basis of the curia. At the time, all Roman people were divided amongst a total of thirty Curia. The Curia were organized on the basis of the family, and thus the ethnic structure of early Rome. Each Curia even had its own festivals, gods, and religious rites. The thirty Curia would gather into a legislative assembly, the Curiate Assembly (comitia curiata). This assembly was created shortly after the founding of the city in 753 BC, and formally elected new Roman kings. During this time, plebeians had no political rights. Each plebeian family was dependent on a particular patrician family. Thus, each plebeian family belonged to the same Curia as did its patrician patron. While the plebeians each belonged to a particular Curia, only patricians could actually vote in the Curiate Assembly. Before the first plebeian secession (in 494 BC), the plebeians probably did gather into their own assembly on the basis of the Curia. However, this assembly probably had no political role until the offices of Plebeian Tribune and Plebeian Aedile were created that year, in order to end the secession. As a result of the plebeian secession, the patrician aristocracy formally recognized the political power of the Plebeian Tribune. When they legitimized the power of the plebeian tribune, they legitimized the power of the assembly (the "Plebeian Curiate Assembly") that the Plebeian Tribune presided over. This "Plebeian Curiate Assembly" was the original Plebeian Council. After 494 BC, the "Plebeian Curiate Assembly" would always be presided over by a Plebeian Tribune. This assembly would elect the Plebeian Tribunes and the Plebeian Aediles, and would pass legislation (plebiscita) that would only apply to the plebeians. During the later years of the Roman Kingdom, the king Servius Tullius enacted a series of constitutional reforms. One of these reforms resulted in the creation of a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was created by Tullius to assist in future reorganizations of the army". Its divisions were not ethnic (as the divisions of the Curia were), but rather geographical. Tullius had divided the city into four geographical districts, each encompassing a single Tribe. Between the reign of Tullius and the late third century BC, the number of Tribes would expand from four to thirty five. However, by 471 BC, the plebeians decided that organization by Tribe granted them a level of political independence from their patrician patrons that the Curia did not. Therefore, around 471 BC, a law was passed, which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Thus, the "Plebeian Curiate Assembly" began to use Tribes, rather than Curia, as its basis for organization. As such, the Plebeian Council transitioned from its prior status as a "Plebeian Curiate Assembly" to its new status as a "Plebeian Tribal Assembly". The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both plebeians and patricians. However, almost all Romans were always plebeians. Therefore, the principal differences between the Plebeian Council and the Tribal Assembly were mostly legal, rather than demographic. These legal differences derived from the fact that Roman Law didnt recognize an assembly consisting of only one group of people (plebeians in this case) from an assembly consisting of all of the People of Rome. Over time, however, these legal differences were mitigated with legislation. The Plebeian Council elected two plebeian officers, the Tribunes and the Aediles, and thus Roman law classified these two officers as the elected representatives of the plebeians. As such, they acted as the presiding officers of this assembly. The Plebeian Council did survive the fall of the Roman Republic, however it quickly lost its legislative, judicial and electoral powers to the senate. By virtue of their statuses as perpetual Tribunes, both Julius Caesar, as well as his successor, the Emperor Augustus, always had absolute control over the Plebeian Council. The Plebeian Council disappeared shortly after the reign of the Emperor Tiberius.</English>

Der geschichtliche Ursprung der Volksversammlungen liegt im antiken Griechenland, wo zahlreiche Stadtstaaten (poleis) &#252;ber diese Einrichtung verf&#252;gten. Am bekanntesten ist sicherlich die athenische Volksversammlung, an der alle athenischen Vollb&#252;rger teilnehmen durften und die mehrmals im Monat an festem Ort zusammentrat, um &#252;ber die wichtigsten Belange des Staates zu entscheiden. In der R&#246;mischen Republik gab es dreierlei Volksversammlungen, die Comitia Centuriata, die Comitia Populi Tributa und das Concilium Plebis. Anders als in vielen modernen Systemen wurde in diesen K&#246;rperschaften Legislative, Jurisdiktion und Wahlrecht nicht getrennt. Sie verf&#252;gten &#252;ber die M&#246;glichkeit, Gesetze r&#252;ckwirkend (ex post facto) zu &#228;ndern. Der R&#246;mische Senat dagegen war formal eine beratende Kammer und besa&#223; theoretisch keine legislative oder richterliche Macht. Die Comitia Centuriata umfassten Patrizier und Plebejer die in f&#252;nf Klassen organisiert waren. Die Gliederung nach Centurien stammt aus dem Heerwesen, die Comitia Centuriata sind also gewisserma&#223;en die Versammlung des r&#246;mischen Volkes als Heeresversammlung. Die Comitia Populi Tributa umfassten Patrizier und Plebejer, verteilt auf die 35 St&#228;mme (tribus), in die alle r&#246;mischen B&#252;rger zu Verwaltungs- und Wahlzwecken eingeordnet waren. Die &#252;berw&#228;ltigende Mehrheit der st&#228;dtischen Bev&#246;lkerung Roms geh&#246;rte zu den vier st&#228;dtischen St&#228;mmen, und da auch hier die einzelnen Stimmen nicht entscheidend waren (wie bei den Comitia Centuriata war die Stimmabgabe indirekt, innerhalb des Stammes, der wiederum nur eine Stimme in den Comitia Populi Tributa hatte), so dass Wahlergebnisse vor allem vom Verhalten der 31 l&#228;ndlichen St&#228;mme abh&#228;ngig waren. Die Comitia Populi Tributa trafen sich im Comitium auf dem Forum Romanum. Sie w&#228;hlten die kurulischen Aedile (aediles curules), die Quaestoren, und die Milit&#228;rtribunen (tribuni militum). Vor ihnen wurden Gerichtsverhandlungen abgehalten, bis der Diktator Sulla die st&#228;ndigen Gerichtsh&#246;fe etablierte. Das Concilium Plebis war wie die Comitia Populi Tributa eine Stammesversammlung, allerdings nur der Plebejer unter Ausschluss aller Patrizier, die auch nicht an den Zusammenk&#252;nften teilnehmen durften. Nur die Volkstribunen (Tribuni plebis) konnten das Concilium Plebis einberufen; es traf sich &#252;blicherweise im Comitium auf dem Forum Romanum. Patrizische Senatoren beobachteten die Versammlung h&#228;ufig von den Stufen der Curia Hostilia aus und versuchten von hier aus, Einfluss auf die Tribunen zu nehmen. Das Concilium Plebis war die bevorzugte Legislative der Republik, obwohl technisch seine Gesetze Plebiszite genannt wurden. Es w&#228;hlte die plebejischen Aedile (aediles plebis) und die Volkstribunen, und f&#252;hrte Gerichtsverhandlungen durch, bis der Diktator Lucius Cornelius Sulla die st&#228;ndigen Gerichtsh&#246;fe etablierte.</German>
		<Italian>The Concilium Plebis-known in English as the Plebeian Council or Peoples Assembly-was the principal popular assembly of the ancient Roman Republic. It functioned as a legislative assembly, through which the plebeians (commoners) could pass laws, elect magistrates, and try judicial cases. The Plebeian Council was originally organized on the basis of the Curia. Thus, it was originally a "Plebeian Curiate Assembly". Around the year 471 BC, it was reorganized on the basis of the Tribes. Thus, it became a "Plebeian Tribal Assembly". The Plebeian Council usually met in the well of the Comitia. Often patrician senators would observe from the steps of the Curia Hostilia, and would sometimes heckle during meetings. The representatives of the Plebians in government are called Tribunes. These Tribunes had the power to veto the laws of the Senate. When the Roman Republic was founded in 509 BC, the Roman people were organized on the basis of the curia. At the time, all Roman people were divided amongst a total of thirty Curia. The Curia were organized on the basis of the family, and thus the ethnic structure of early Rome. Each Curia even had its own festivals, gods, and religious rites. The thirty Curia would gather into a legislative assembly, the Curiate Assembly (comitia curiata). This assembly was created shortly after the founding of the city in 753 BC, and formally elected new Roman kings. During this time, plebeians had no political rights. Each plebeian family was dependent on a particular patrician family. Thus, each plebeian family belonged to the same Curia as did its patrician patron. While the plebeians each belonged to a particular Curia, only patricians could actually vote in the Curiate Assembly. Before the first plebeian secession (in 494 BC), the plebeians probably did gather into their own assembly on the basis of the Curia. However, this assembly probably had no political role until the offices of Plebeian Tribune and Plebeian Aedile were created that year, in order to end the secession. As a result of the plebeian secession, the patrician aristocracy formally recognized the political power of the Plebeian Tribune. When they legitimized the power of the plebeian tribune, they legitimized the power of the assembly (the "Plebeian Curiate Assembly") that the Plebeian Tribune presided over. This "Plebeian Curiate Assembly" was the original Plebeian Council. After 494 BC, the "Plebeian Curiate Assembly" would always be presided over by a Plebeian Tribune. This assembly would elect the Plebeian Tribunes and the Plebeian Aediles, and would pass legislation (plebiscita) that would only apply to the plebeians. During the later years of the Roman Kingdom, the king Servius Tullius enacted a series of constitutional reforms. One of these reforms resulted in the creation of a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was created by Tullius to assist in future reorganizations of the army". Its divisions were not ethnic (as the divisions of the Curia were), but rather geographical. Tullius had divided the city into four geographical districts, each encompassing a single Tribe. Between the reign of Tullius and the late third century BC, the number of Tribes would expand from four to thirty five. However, by 471 BC, the plebeians decided that organization by Tribe granted them a level of political independence from their patrician patrons that the Curia did not. Therefore, around 471 BC, a law was passed, which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Thus, the "Plebeian Curiate Assembly" began to use Tribes, rather than Curia, as its basis for organization. As such, the Plebeian Council transitioned from its prior status as a "Plebeian Curiate Assembly" to its new status as a "Plebeian Tribal Assembly". The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both plebeians and patricians. However, almost all Romans were always plebeians. Therefore, the principal differences between the Plebeian Council and the Tribal Assembly were mostly legal, rather than demographic. These legal differences derived from the fact that Roman Law didnt recognize an assembly consisting of only one group of people (plebeians in this case) from an assembly consisting of all of the People of Rome. Over time, however, these legal differences were mitigated with legislation. The Plebeian Council elected two plebeian officers, the Tribunes and the Aediles, and thus Roman law classified these two officers as the elected representatives of the plebeians. As such, they acted as the presiding officers of this assembly. The Plebeian Council did survive the fall of the Roman Republic, however it quickly lost its legislative, judicial and electoral powers to the senate. By virtue of their statuses as perpetual Tribunes, both Julius Caesar, as well as his successor, the Emperor Augustus, always had absolute control over the Plebeian Council. The Plebeian Council disappeared shortly after the reign of the Emperor Tiberius.</Italian>
		<Spanish>La Antigua rep&#250;blica romana (en lat&#237;n: Res Publica Romanorum) ten&#237;a los poderes gubernamentales separados en 4 asambleas: el Comicio por curias, el Comicio por centurias, el Comicio por tribus' y el Concilium Plebis (Consejo de la Plebe).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A diferencia de las c&#225;maras modernas, estos cuerpos representativos combinaban las funciones jur&#237;dicas, legislativas y electorales, como lo hac&#237;an tambi&#233;n los magistrados. Aunque no exist&#237;a una separaci&#243;n clara de poderes, el intrincado equilibrio constitucional y la divisi&#243;n de los poderes en la Rep&#250;blica fue notablemente elaborado. Ellos pose&#237;an el poder para hacer leyes ex post facto , retroactivamente haciendo un acto dado ilegal. Hay que denotar que al principio el Senado Romano era una c&#225;mara deliberadora, y no pose&#237;a poderes legislativos ni jur&#237;dicos, pero con el tiempo se convirtio en el centro de poder de la rep&#250;blica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El Comicio por Curias era la m&#225;s antigua asamblea romana despu&#233;s del Comisio Calata. Cada una de las 3 tribus antiguas ten&#237;a 10 curias, y estas a su vez 100 hombres. En total eran entonces 3000 personas que constitu&#237;an las curias juntas. Este &#243;rgano, en un principio, eleg&#237;a a los m&#225;s altos magistrados, pero posteriormente s&#243;lo confirmaba e inauguraba las elecciones de la Asamblea por Centurias.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El Comicio por centurias inclu&#237;a a patricios y plebeyos organizados dentro de 5 clases econ&#243;micas (teor&#237;a hoy en d&#237;a bastante desechada por cualquier historiador; pocos hablan de m&#225;s de dos clases [ako])(los Caballeros y Senadores eran la Primera Clase) y distribuidos entre divisiones internas llamadas centurias. La membres&#237;a de la Asamblea requer&#237;a cierto estatus econ&#243;mico, y poder el cual principalmente reca&#237;a en los miembros de la primera y segunda clases. La asamblea se reun&#237;a anualmente para elegir a los c&#243;nsules y pretores, y cada cinco a&#241;os para elegir a los Censores. Tambi&#233;n se reun&#237;an para intentar casos de alta traici&#243;n (perduellio), aunque esta &#250;ltima funci&#243;n cay&#243; en desuso despu&#233;s de que Lucio Apuleyo Saturnino introdujera un formato m&#225;s realizable (maiestas). (traici&#243;n peque&#241;a)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El voto de un ciudadano no contaba dentro de la Asamblea por Centurias. M&#225;s, el voto individual era contado dentro de su Centuria y determinaba el voto final de aquella Centuria. A causa de que s&#243;lo las primeras 18 Centurias (reservadas a la clase Patricia) mas las 80 con mas de 100.000 ases, pose&#237;an un n&#250;mero nominal de miembros (98), miembros de otras Centurias ejerc&#237;an una influencia desproporcional sobre los votos finales de cada una de ellas. (el total de centurias era de 193).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El comicio por Tribus incluye a patricios y plebeyos distribuidos entre 35 tribus en las cuales todos los ciudadanos romanos son ubicados para prop&#243;sitos administrativos y electorales. La mayor&#237;a de la poblaci&#243;n urbana de Roma estaba distribuida entre 4 tribus urbanas, lo cual significaba que sus votos individuales eran insignificantes. Como en la Asamblea por Centurias, el voto era indirecto, con 1 voto proporcionado por cada tribu. El voto era por lo tanto inclinado en favor de las 31 tribus rurales. La asamblea por tribus se reun&#237;a en el Foro Romano, eleg&#237;a a los ediles (curules solamente), y los cuestores. Pero a los tribunos de la plebe no lo eleg&#237;a la asamblea tribal, sino la asamblea de la plebe, a la que no ten&#237;an acceso los patricios. La asamblea por tribus condujo adem&#225;s, la mayor&#237;a de los juicios, hasta que el dictador Lucio Cornelio Sila estableciera las Cortes (quaestiones).</Spanish>

		<English>Aristocracy, Greek aristokrata, from aristos (excellent), and kratos (power), is a form of government in which the best qualified citizens rule. The term was derived from the Greek aristokratia, meaning "rule of the best. The concept evolved in Ancient Greece, whereby a council of famous citizens was commonly used and contrasted with "direct monarchy" in which an individual king held the power. The Ancient Greeks did not like the concept of monarchy, and as their democratic system fell, aristocracy was upheld. The term "aristocracy" was first given in Athens to young citizens (the men of the ruling class) who led armies from the front line. Because military bravery was highly regarded as a virtue in ancient Greece, it was assumed that the armies were being led by "the best". From the ancient Greeks, the term passed on to the European Middle Ages for a similar hereditary class of military leaders often referred to as the "nobility". As in Greece, this was a class of privileged men and women whose familial connections to the regional armies allowed them to present themselves as the most "noble" or "best." In Rome, The Republic consisted of an aristocracy as well as consuls, a senate, and a tribal assembly. The Republic ended with the death of Julius Caesar on March 15, 44 BC. Later, aristocracies primarily consisted of an elite aristocratic class, privileged by birth and often by wealth. Since the French Revolution, aristocracy has generally been contrasted with democracy, in which all citizens hold some form of political power. However this distinction is oversimplified.</English>

		<German>Der Begriff Aristokratie bezeichnet in der ideengeschichtlichen Forschung die Herrschaft einer Gruppe weniger Auserw&#228;hlter, das hei&#223;t dass eine relativ kleine Zahl besonders bef&#228;higter Individuen politische Leitungsfunktionen wahrnimmt, wobei die Art der Bef&#228;higung nicht n&#228;her bestimmt ist. Die urspr&#252;ngliche Wortbedeutung ist Herrschaft der Besten. In der politischen Wirklichkeit wurde die Eigenschaft zu den Besten zu geh&#246;ren meist mit der Zugeh&#246;rigkeit zu einer adligen Oberschicht gleichgesetzt, weshalb man unter Aristokratie seit der Antike die Herrschaft des Adels verstand. In der historischen Literatur wird der Begriff Aristokratie oft synonym zu Adel als der Gesamtheit aller Adligen in einem bestimmten geografischen Bereich verwendet. Im Mittelalter werden darunter zumeist keine merklichen Vorz&#252;ge, sondern die famili&#228;re Abstammung und die Zugeh&#246;rigkeit zu einer festen sozialen Gruppe verstanden. Die Aristokratie bei Platon ist die am Gemeinwohl orientierte idealtypische Herrschaft der Besten. Sie f&#228;llt wie die Oligarchie unter die Herrschaft der Wenigen, wobei die Oligarchie als die am Eigennutz Weniger ausgerichtete Herrschaftsform definiert ist. Diese Idee wurde zun&#228;chst von seinem Sch&#252;ler Aristoteles und sp&#228;ter vom griechischen Historiker Polybios (um 200 v. Chr. bis etwa 118 v. Chr.) weiterentwickelt. Grunds&#228;tzlich bestand in der Staatstheorie seit Platon die Idee, dass jede am Gemeinwohl orientierte Herrschaftsform (Monarchie [auch: Basileia], Aristokratie, Demokratie) ein entartetes, nur an den Interessen der Herrschenden orientiertes Gegenst&#252;ck hat (Tyrannis, Oligarchie, Ochlokratie). Diese Theorie der Verfassungsformen ist aus der Beobachtung und Analyse der Politik antiker griechischer Stadtstaaten abstrahiert. Empirisch haben die Autoren dagegen vor allem Mischformen gefunden.</German>

		<English>Oligarchy (from Greek, oligarkha) is a form of power structure in which power effectively rests with a small number of people. These people could be distinguished by royalty, wealth, family ties, corporate, or military control. The word oligarchy is from the Greek words olgos (a few) and the verb archo (to rule, to govern, to command). Such states are often controlled by a few prominent families who pass their influence from one generation to the next. Throughout history, some oligarchies have been tyrannical, relying on public servitude to exist, although others have been relatively benign. Aristotle pioneered the use of the term as a synonym for rule by the rich, for which the exact term is plutocracy, but oligarchy is not always a rule by wealth, as oligarchs can simply be a privileged group, and do not have to be connected by bloodlines as in a monarchy. Some city-states from ancient Greece were oligarchies. Especially during the Fourth Century BC, after the restoration of democracy from oligarchical coups, the Athenians used the drawing of lots for selecting government officers in order to counteract what the Athenians acutely saw as a tendency toward oligarchy in government if a professional governing class were allowed to use their skills for their own benefit. They drew lots from large groups of adult volunteers as a selection technique for civil servants performing judicial, executive, and administrative functions (archai, boule, and heliastai). They even used lots for very important posts, such as judges and jurors in the political courts (nomothetai), which had the power to overrule the Assembly.</English>

Zur Abgrenzung von dieser Bedeutung und in Besinnung auf den eigentlichen Wortsinn wird heute auch der an sich gleichbedeutende Begriff Oligokratie verwendet. Die Oligarchie bei Platon (427-347 v.

		<English>Martial law is the imposition of military rule by military authorities over designated regions on an emergency basisusually only temporarywhen the civilian government or civilian authorities fail to function effectively (e.g., maintain order and security, and provide essential services), when there are extensive riots and protests, or when the disobedience of the law becomes widespread. In most cases, military forces are deployed to quiet the crowds, to secure government buildings and key or sensitive locations, and to maintain order. Generally, military personnel replace civil authorities and perform some or all of their functions. The constitution could be suspended, and in full-scale martial law, the highest ranking military General would take over, or be installed, as the military governor or as head of the government, thus removing all power from the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the federal government. Martial law can be used by governments to enforce their rule over the public. Such incidents may occur after a coup dtat (Thailand 2006); when threatened by popular protest (China, Tiananmen Square protests of 1989); to suppress political opposition (Poland in 1981); to stabilize insurrections or perceived insurrections (Canada, The October Crisis of 1970). Martial law may be declared in cases of major natural disasters, however most countries use a different legal construct, such as a "state of emergency". Martial law has also been imposed during conflicts and in cases of occupations, where the absence of any other civil government provides for an unstable population. Examples of this form of military rule include post World War II reconstruction in Germany and Japan as well as the southern reconstruction following the U.S. Civil War. Typically, the imposition of martial law accompanies curfews, the suspension of civil law, civil rights, habeas corpus, and the application or extension of military law or military justice to civilians. Civilians defying martial law may be subjected to military tribunal (court-martial).</English>

		<Spanish>La Ley marcial es un estatuto de excepci&#243;n de aplicaci&#243;n de las normas legales ordinarias (normalmente regulado en la Constituci&#243;n del Estado), por medio del cual se otorgan facultades extraordinarias a las fuerzas o la polic&#237;a en cuanto a la administraci&#243;n de justicia y resguardo del orden p&#250;blico.

En muchos casos de ley marcial, la pena de muerte es impuesta para cr&#237;menes que normalmente no ser&#237;an cr&#237;menes capitales, como el saqueo o robos en caso de cat&#225;strofes. Los llamados normalmente a ejercer la ley marcial son los tribunales militares.</Spanish>

		<English>Civil and political rights are a class of rights that protect individuals freedom from unwarranted infringement by governments and private organizations, and ensure ones ability to participate in the civil and political life of the state without discrimination or repression. The phrase "civil rights" is a translation of Latin ius civis (rights of citizens). Roman citizens could be either free (libertas) or servile (servitus), but they all had rights in law. After the Edict of the Milan in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion. Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on religious doctrine.</English>

		<German>Ein B&#252;rgerrecht ist ein gesetzliches Recht, das ein Staat oder eine vergleichbare Einrichtung den Mitgliedern seines Staatsvolkes (seinen B&#252;rgern) zugesteht. Zu den B&#252;rgerrechten in einer Demokratie geh&#246;ren beispielsweise das Wahlrecht und alle anderen Grundrechte, die nicht Menschenrechte sind (welche nicht nur auf die B&#252;rger eines Staates zu beziehen sind). Unter B&#252;rgerrechten versteht man im Allgemeinen aber nur solche Rechte, die sich auf das Verh&#228;ltnis zwischen B&#252;rger und Staat beziehen, und weniger auf das Verh&#228;ltnis von Einwohnern des Staates untereinander. Der Status eines B&#252;rgers und die damit verbundenen B&#252;rgerrechte standen nicht immer allen Einwohnern eines Landes oder einer Stadt zu. So war in mittelalterlichen Stadtverfassungen das B&#252;rgerrecht ein Privileg, das nur bestimmten Einwohnern der Stadt zuteil wurde. Die Verleihung der B&#252;rgerrechte erfolgte in vielen europ&#228;ischen St&#228;dten in der Zeit zwischen dem Mittelalter und zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts, durch Aufnahme in die B&#252;rgerrolle und die Erteilung des B&#252;rgerbriefes.</German>

		<English>Autarky is the quality of being self-sufficient. Usually the term is applied to political states or their economic systems. Autarky exists whenever an entity can survive or continue its activities without external assistance or international trade. If a self-sufficient economy also refuses all trade with the outside world then it is called a closed economy. Autarky is not necessarily an economic phenomenon; for example, a military autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country. Autarky can be said to be the policy of a state or other entity when it seeks to be self-sufficient as a whole, but also can be limited to a narrow field such as possession of a key raw material. For example, many countries have a policy of autarky with respect to foodstuffs and water for national security reasons.</English>

		<English>Colonization (or colonisation) occurs whenever any one or more species populate an area. The term, which is derived from the Latin colere (to inhabit, cultivate, frequent, practice, tend, guard, respect), originally related to humans. In ancient times, maritime nations such as the city-states of Greece and Phoenicia often established colonies to farm uninhabited land. In classical times, land suitable for farming was often claimed by migratory "barbarian tribes" who lived by hunting and gathering. To ancient civilized people, the land simply appeared vacant. However this does not mean that conflict did not exist between the colonizers and native peoples. In Asia, under the Achaemenid Empire, ethnic Persians did some colonizing in their new territory, such as Egypt. After the Rise of Parthia in west of Asia some ethnic Persians settled in India. The Pallava Empire was born in India , made by Persian colonies that had settled there. Another period of colonization in Ancient times was from the Romans. The Roman Empire conquered a large part of Western Europe, North Africa and West Asia. In North Africa and west Asia they were often conquering civilized peoples, but as they moved north into Europe they mostly encountered rural tribes with very little in the way of cities. In these areas, waves of Roman colonization often followed the conquest of the areas. Many of the current cities around Europe began as Roman colonies, such as the German city Kln (Cologne), which was originally called Colonia Claudia by the Romans; and the British capital city of London which the Romans founded as Londinium.</English>

		<German>Kolonisation oder Kolonisierung bedeutet die Gr&#252;ndung und Entwicklung von Kolonien (lat. colonia: Ansiedlung). In der Antike traten besonders die Minoer, Ph&#246;nizier, Griechen, Karthager und R&#246;mer als Kolonisten in Erscheinung. Den Minoern, auf Kreta ans&#228;ssig, ging es nicht um Landnahme, sondern die Sicherung ihres Seehandels in der &#196;g&#228;is, aber auch nach Kleinasien und &#196;gypten. Die Kolonien der Minoer dienten als Ankerpl&#228;tze und Handelsposten. Die ionische Kolonisation, bei der-nach antiken Quellen-ab ca. 1050 v. Chr. die St&#228;dte an der Westk&#252;ste Kleinasiens von Ioniern besiedelt wurden, ist eine Landnahme. Da&#223; sie stattgefunden hat, gilt als wahrscheinlich. Das fr&#252;heste Datum ist 1053 v. Chr. f&#252;r Milet. Die Gro&#223;e Griechische Kolonisation zwischen ca. 750 und 550 v. Chr. In ihrem Verlauf verlassen Griechen insbesondere die Peloponnes und gehen nach Nordafrika (Tripolis/Tripolis Libyen, Epta Aderfia/Ceuta), Kleinasien (Byzantion/Byzanz, Trapezus/Trabzon), in die nordpontischen Gebiete (Odessos/Warna, Dioskurias/Sochumi), nach Spanien (Saguntum/Sagunt), S&#252;dfrankreich (Massillia/Marseilles, Nikaia/Nizza), Dalmatien (Aspalatos/Split, Faros/Hvar, Yvis/Insel Vis), Sizilien und S&#252;ditalien (Kyme/Cumae, Neapolis/Neapel, Posaidinia/Paestum, Rhegion/Reggio, Kroton und Tarent), Vorderer Orient (Tripolis/Tripolis Libanon). Die Besonderheit dieser Kolonien war, dass Planst&#228;dte nach griechischem Muster dauerhaft bewohnt wurden. Die ersten Siedler f&#252;hlten sich als Griechen bzw. als Angeh&#246;rige ihrer Heimatpolis. Es gab Konflikte mit den Einheimischen, die Kolonien waren aber nicht auf Ausbeutung angelegt, so dass auch hier prim&#228;r Landnahme vorliegt. Die griechischen Kolonisten standen im Wettstreit mit den Ph&#246;niziern. Auf Korsika vereitelten die Ph&#246;nizier zusammen mit den verb&#252;ndeten Etruskern griechische Kolonisationsversuche, daf&#252;r drangen die Griechen an die Rhne-M&#252;ndung und nach Spanien vor. Anfang des 1. Jahrtausend v. Chr. begann von Ph&#246;nizien aus eine &#228;hnliche Kolonisierungswelle. Ph&#246;nizische H&#228;ndler errichteten an der nordafrikanischen K&#252;ste Niederlassungen. Sp&#228;ter stie&#223;en sie bis zur Stra&#223;e von Gibraltar vor. Bekannteste Gr&#252;ndung war die Stadt Karthago im heutigen Tunesien. Karthago machte sich selbst&#228;ndig und blieb jahrhundertelang f&#252;hrende Macht im westlichen Mittelmeer. Statt gewaltsamer Besetzung arrangierten sich Ph&#246;nizier und Karthager auf Vertragsbasis mit den lokalen Herrschern. Auch ohne Eroberung kam es letztlich doch zur gro&#223;fl&#228;chigen Landnahme der Karthager auf Sardinien (Sulci, Tharros etc.) und in West-Sizilien.</German>

		<English>Centralisation (or centralization) is the process by which the activities of an organisation, particularly those regarding planning decision-making, become concentrated within a particular location and/or group. Political science as a separate field is a relatively late arrival in terms of social sciences. However, the term "political science" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state. The antecedents of Western politics can be traced back to the Socratic political philosophers, Plato (427347 BC), Xenophon (c. 430354 BC), and Aristotle ("The Father of Political Science") (384322 BC). These authors, in such works as The Republic and Laws by Plato, and The Politics and Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle, analyzed political systems philosophically, going beyond earlier Greek poetic and historical reflections which can be found in the works of epic poets like Homer and Hesiod, historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, and dramatists such as Sophocles, Aristophanes, and Euripides. During the height of the Roman Empire, famous historians such as Polybius, Livy and Plutarch documented the rise of the Roman Republic, and the organization and histories of other nations, while statesmen like Julius Caesar, Cicero and others provided us with examples of the politics of the republic and Romes empire and wars. The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments. Nearly a thousand years elapsed, from the foundation of the city of Rome in 753 BC to the fall of the Roman Empire or the beginning of the Middle Ages. In the interim, there is a manifest translation of Hellenic culture into the Roman sphere. The Greek gods become Romans and Greek philosophy in one way or another turns into Roman law e.g. Stoicism. The Stoic was committed to preserving proper hierarchical roles and duties in the state so that the state as a whole would remain stable. Among the best known Roman Stoics were philosopher Seneca and the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Seneca, a wealthy Roman patrician, is often criticized by some modern commentators for failing to adequately live by his own precepts. The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, on the other hand, can be best thought of as the philosophical reflections of an emperor divided between his philosophical aspirations and the duty he felt to defend the Roman Empire from its external enemies through his various military campaigns. According to Polybius, Roman institutions were the backbone of the empire but Roman law is the medulla.</English>

		<English>Syncretism is the attempt to reconcile contrary beliefs, often while melding practices of various schools of thought. The term means "combining," but see below for the origin of the word. Syncretism may involve attempts to merge and analogise several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, and thus assert an underlying unity allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. Syncretism also occurs commonly in expressions of arts and culture as well as politics. The word syncretism derives from modern Latin syncretismus, drawing on Greek synkretismos, meaning "Cretan federation." The Greek word occurs in Plutarchs (1st century AD) essay on "Fraternal Love" in his Moralia. He cites the example of the Cretans, who reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. "And that is their so-called Syncretism." Syncretism functioned as a feature of Ancient Greek religion. Overall, Hellenistic culture in the age that followed Alexander the Great itself showed syncretist features, essentially blending of Mesopotamian, Persian, Anatolian, Egyptian (and eventually Etruscan-Roman) elements within an Hellenic formula. The Egyptian god Amun developed as the Hellenized Zeus Ammon after Alexander the Great went into the desert to seek out Amuns oracle at Siwa. Such identifications derive from interpretatio graeca, the Hellenic habit of identifying gods of disparate mythologies with their own. When the proto-Greeks (peoples whose language would evolve into Greek proper) first arrived in the Aegean and on the mainland of modern-day Greece early in the 2nd millennium BCE, they found localized nymphs and divinities already connected with every important feature of the landscape: mountain, cave, grove and spring all had their own locally venerated deity. The countless epithets of the Olympian gods reflect their syncretic identification with these various figures. One defines "Zeus Molossos" (worshipped only at Dodona) as "the god identical to Zeus as worshipped by the Molossians at Dodona". Much of the apparently arbitrary and trivial mythic fabling results from later mythographers attempts to explain these obscure epithets.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIVIC_AMPHIKTIONIE_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>In the Archaic period of ancient Greece, an amphictyony, a "league of neighbors", or Amphictyonic League was an ancient association of Greek tribes formed in the dim past, before the rise of the Greek polis. The six Dorian cities of coastal southwest Asia Minor, or the twelve Ionian cities to the north, a dodecapolis forming an Ionian League emerging in the aftermath of a dimly-remembered "Meliac war" in the mid-7th century BCE, were already of considerable antiquity when the first written records emerge. Thucydides made recollection of the Lelantine War, apparently fought in Euboea sometime between the late 8th century BCE and the first half of the 7th century BCE: "The war between Chalcis and Eretria was the one in which most cities belonging to the rest of Greece were divided up into alliances with one side or the other." Historians have puzzled over the broader meanings of "alliance" in such early times. "But comparatively large-scale associations lead more readily to contacts, to friendships and enmities at a distance than do little city-like units," George Forrest notes, remarking apropos that Phrygia and Assyria were at war with each other about 720-710 BCE, raising tensions among interested Greeks. In historic times, an amphictyony might survive as a form of religious organization enjoined to support specific temples or sacred places; traditional amphictyonies coordinated Olympic and Pythian games. Twelve members would meet at specific times in the same sanctuary to keep religious festivals and conduct other matters as well. An early amphictyony centered on Kalaureia, an island close to the coast of Troezen in the Peloponnesus sacred to Poseidon, was noted by Strabo. Archaeology of the site suggested to Thomas Kelly that the sacred league was founded in the second quarter of the 7th century BCE, ca 680-650; before that date there were virtually no remains at the site, which could not have been used more than sporadically. The island was known at one time as Eirene (peace), clearly in reference to the amphictiony. The least obscure and longest-lasting amphictyony was the Delphic or Great Amphictyonic League that was organized to support the greater temples of Apollo and Demeter. The League council had religious authority and the power to pronounce punishments against offenders. Punishments could range from fines to expulsion and to conduct sacred wars. The Amphictyonic League also set the rules of battle as to protect sanctuaries and/or impose sentences on those who molested sanctuaries. Based on legend, the Great Amphictyonic League was founded somewhat after the Trojan War, for the protection and administration of the temple of Apollo in Delphi and temple of Demeter in Anthele, near Thermopylae. The founding myth claimed that it had been founded in the most distant past by an eponymous founder Amphictyon, brother of Hellen, the common ancestor of all Hellenes. Representatives of the twelve members met in Thermopylae in spring and in Delphi in autumn. The twelve founders enumerated by Aeschines were the Aenianes or Oetaeans, the Boeotians of Thebes, the Dolopes, the Dorians of Sparta, the Ionians of Athens, the Phthian Achaeans, the Locrians, Opuntians and Ozolians, the Magnesians, the Malians, the Perrhaebians, the Phocians, the Pythians of Delphi, and the Thessalians. The League doctrine required that no member would be entirely wiped out in war and no water supply of any member would be cut even in wartime. It did not prevent members from fighting about the dominance over the temples. Originally a religious organization, the Amphictyonic League became politically important in the 6th century BCE, when larger city-states began to use it to apply pressure to the lesser ones. In 356 BCE Phocians captured and sacked Delphi, and sacred war was declared against them. After a ten-year war the Phocians were expelled from the League in 346 BCE and their two votes were given to Macedonians who had helped to defeat them. Philip II of Macedonia used its power to further his expansionistic conquests in Greece. In 279, the Phocians were readmitted after they defended Delphi against an attack by the Gauls, and Aetolians who already dominated the Delphi sanctuary were admitted as new members. In the 3rd century BCE the Soteria (festival) was held in honour to the Greek victory against the Gauls. By 191 BCE the League had 17 members but only the most dominant one had the two votes, when others had only one.

		<French>In the Archaic period of ancient Greece, an amphictyony, a "league of neighbors", or Amphictyonic League was an ancient association of Greek tribes formed in the dim past, before the rise of the Greek polis. The six Dorian cities of coastal southwest Asia Minor, or the twelve Ionian cities to the north, a dodecapolis forming an Ionian League emerging in the aftermath of a dimly-remembered "Meliac war" in the mid-7th century BCE, were already of considerable antiquity when the first written records emerge. Thucydides made recollection of the Lelantine War, apparently fought in Euboea sometime between the late 8th century BCE and the first half of the 7th century BCE: "The war between Chalcis and Eretria was the one in which most cities belonging to the rest of Greece were divided up into alliances with one side or the other." Historians have puzzled over the broader meanings of "alliance" in such early times. "But comparatively large-scale associations lead more readily to contacts, to friendships and enmities at a distance than do little city-like units," George Forrest notes, remarking apropos that Phrygia and Assyria were at war with each other about 720-710 BCE, raising tensions among interested Greeks. In historic times, an amphictyony might survive as a form of religious organization enjoined to support specific temples or sacred places; traditional amphictyonies coordinated Olympic and Pythian games. Twelve members would meet at specific times in the same sanctuary to keep religious festivals and conduct other matters as well. An early amphictyony centered on Kalaureia, an island close to the coast of Troezen in the Peloponnesus sacred to Poseidon, was noted by Strabo. Archaeology of the site suggested to Thomas Kelly that the sacred league was founded in the second quarter of the 7th century BCE, ca 680-650; before that date there were virtually no remains at the site, which could not have been used more than sporadically. The island was known at one time as Eirene (peace), clearly in reference to the amphictiony. The least obscure and longest-lasting amphictyony was the Delphic or Great Amphictyonic League that was organized to support the greater temples of Apollo and Demeter. The League council had religious authority and the power to pronounce punishments against offenders. Punishments could range from fines to expulsion and to conduct sacred wars. The Amphictyonic League also set the rules of battle as to protect sanctuaries and/or impose sentences on those who molested sanctuaries. Based on legend, the Great Amphictyonic League was founded somewhat after the Trojan War, for the protection and administration of the temple of Apollo in Delphi and temple of Demeter in Anthele, near Thermopylae. The founding myth claimed that it had been founded in the most distant past by an eponymous founder Amphictyon, brother of Hellen, the common ancestor of all Hellenes. Representatives of the twelve members met in Thermopylae in spring and in Delphi in autumn. The twelve founders enumerated by Aeschines were the Aenianes or Oetaeans, the Boeotians of Thebes, the Dolopes, the Dorians of Sparta, the Ionians of Athens, the Phthian Achaeans, the Locrians, Opuntians and Ozolians, the Magnesians, the Malians, the Perrhaebians, the Phocians, the Pythians of Delphi, and the Thessalians. The League doctrine required that no member would be entirely wiped out in war and no water supply of any member would be cut even in wartime. It did not prevent members from fighting about the dominance over the temples. Originally a religious organization, the Amphictyonic League became politically important in the 6th century BCE, when larger city-states began to use it to apply pressure to the lesser ones.

		<German>Eine Amphiktyonie (gebildet aus griechisch ktizo = wohnen und amphi = um herum) ist ein loser Verband von St&#228;dten im antiken Griechenland, in Kleinasien und Etrurien auf religi&#246;s-kultureller Basis. Diese St&#228;dteb&#252;nde bildeten sich zun&#228;chst um ein Heiligtum, um es zu sch&#252;tzen und zu verwalten. Sp&#228;ter kam die Veranstaltung von Festspielen zu Ehren der Gottheit hinzu. Wann und wo eine Amphiktyonie das erste Mal auftrat, ist unbekannt. Es gibt aber Anzeichen daf&#252;r, dass es sie bereits vor den auf st&#228;dtischem Areal errichteten Heiligt&#252;mern gab. Die bedeutendste Amphiktyonie war aber die von Anthela. Ihr Sitz wurde sp&#228;ter nach Delphi verlegt. Zweck dieses Bundes war zun&#228;chst Schutz der Heiligt&#252;mer der Demeter in Anthela und des Apollon zu Delphi, gemeinschaftliche Feier gewisser Feste, namentlich der pythischen in Delphi. Zur gleichen Zeit diente die Amphiktyonie der Bewahrung eines v&#246;lkerrechtlichen Rechtsschutzes, da&#223; etwa keine der amphiktyonischen St&#228;dte zerst&#246;rt werden, sie vom Wasser abgeschnitten oder vom gemeinschaftlichen Opfer und vom Bundesheiligtum ausgeschlossen werden d&#252;rfe. Die Amphiktyonie hat von den ersten Anf&#228;ngen hellenischer Zivilisation bis zum Untergang der griechischen Freiheit bestanden.</German>

		<Spanish>La anfiction&#237;a (del griego 'ambos' + 'construir', por lo que etimol&#243;gicamente significa 'fundaci&#243;n conjunta') se trataba de una liga religiosa que agrupaba doce pueblos (no ciudades), casi todos de la Grecia central. Ten&#237;a sus reuniones en el santuario de Dem&#233;ter en Antela, cerca de las Term&#243;pilas. Como el or&#225;culo de Delfos ten&#237;a ya un renombre mayor que el de Dem&#233;ter y estaba cercano al Istmo de Corinto (sitio de conjunci&#243;n geogr&#225;fica para el Peloponeso, Jonia y Beocia), trasladaron all&#237; la sede de esta confederaci&#243;n, sin por ello abandonar el otro santuario. Se reun&#237;an dos veces al a&#241;o, alternando Delfos con Antela. Cuando se fund&#243; ten&#237;a un car&#225;cter puramente religioso, pero poco a poco fue cambiando para terminar siendo verdaderamente pol&#237;tico, con grandes influencias en decisiones de esta &#237;ndole.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El consejo de los hieromnemon inclu&#237;a a hombres designados por cada comunidad. Los 12 pueblos escog&#237;an a los 24 miembros de este consejo:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  2 aqueos de Fti&#243;tide.[NEWLINE]  2 beocios de Tebas.[NEWLINE]  2 dorios de Esparta y D&#243;rida.[NEWLINE]  2 enianos.[NEWLINE]  2 focios.[NEWLINE]  2 jonios de Atenas.[NEWLINE]  2 locrios.[NEWLINE]  2 magnesios.[NEWLINE]  2 malienos.[NEWLINE]  2 perrhabios.[NEWLINE]  2 pitios de Delfos.[NEWLINE]  2 tesalios.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Era muy importante el hecho de conservar la hegemon&#237;a en la administraci&#243;n del templo de Apolo de Delfos y por eso la liga luch&#243; en tres de las guerras sagradas que tuvieron lugar y que en cierto modo fueron desencadenadas por los miembros de la Anfiction&#237;a. La tercera guerra sagrada del 356 a. C. caus&#243; un importante cambio pues en esa ocasi&#243;n los focidios saquearon el templo de Apolo de Delfos, y la Anfiction&#237;a solicit&#243; ayuda al Reino de Macedonia para colaborar en la lucha. Cuando en 346 a. C. los macedonios derrotaron a los focidios, los votos de F&#243;cida se entregaron a Macedonia, lo cual tuvo graves consecuencias despu&#233;s. Durante la cuarta guerra (del 339 a. C. al 338 a. C.) Filipo II de Macedonia aprovech&#243; su posici&#243;n en la Liga y acab&#243; dominando las cuestiones pol&#237;ticas y militares en los pueblos griegos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La Liga luch&#243; en tres Guerras Sagradas desencadenadas por ella para dominar el templo de Apolo en Delfos: la primera (595 &#8211; 585 a.

C.), el rey Filipo II de Macedonia us&#243; su posici&#243;n en la Liga para dominar los asuntos de Grecia, hasta que lo logr&#243; tras la Batalla de Queronea. La Anfiction&#237;a continu&#243; existiendo pero apenas para atender asuntos puramente religiosos; tal situaci&#243;n persisti&#243; durante el gobierno de Alejandro Magno y sus sucesores, e inclusive durante los primeros siglos de la dominaci&#243;n romana de Grecia, empezada en el siglo II a.

		<English>A ruler cult is a form of state religion in which an emperor, or a dynasty of emperors (or rulers of another title), are worshipped as messiahs, demigods or deities. "Cult" here is used to mean "worship", not in the modern pejorative sense. The cult may be one of personality in the case of a newly arisen Euhemerus figure or one of national identity (e.g., Egyptian Pharaoh, Ethiopian Empire or Empire of Japan) or supranational identity in the case of a multi-ethnic state (e.g., Imperial Era China, Roman Empire). A divine king is a monarch who is held in a special religious significance by his subjects, and serves as both head of state and a deity or head religious figure. This system of government combines theocracy with an absolute monarchy.</English>

		<German>Herrscherkult ist die kultische Verehrung, die einem politischen Herrscher entgegengebracht wird. Sie gilt entweder dem Amt des Herrschers, z. B. der Institution des K&#246;nigtums, oder der Familie des Herrschers (bes. wo diesem g&#246;ttliche Abstammung zugesprochen wird), oder aber seiner konkreten Person, wenn diese als sichtbarer Gott gilt. Im Herrscherkult gilt der Herrscher als ein Mittler zwischen der Welt des Menschen und dem Bereich des G&#246;ttlichen. Er ist Zentrum und Schwerpunkt seines Wirkungsbereiches, der sich in seiner Person als in einem Mikrokosmos spiegelt. Herrscherkult ist daher dem Gl&#228;ubigen gleichzeitig Verehrung des Ganzen, des Kollektivs, der Ethnie, des Reiches oder Staates. Diese werden als Kosmos gesehen, der nach einem Weltgesetz geordnet ist, das sich wiederum im Herrscher verk&#246;rpert und von ihm aufrechterhalten wird. Auf der Ebene der Zeit ist die Regierung des Herrschers eine kleine Weltzeit, ihr Beginn ein kleiner Weltenbeginn, ihr Ende ein kleines Weltende. Die Person des Herrschers ist neben der profanen Zeit auch immer in der Urzeit des Mythos gegenw&#228;rtig, die die Ewigkeit der Zeitlosigkeit ist. &#196;hnlich, jedoch nicht gleich einem geistlichen Oberhaupt steht der Herrscher allein oder bevorzugt einem wie auch immer gearteten Transzendenten gegen&#252;ber: Dem Untertan manifestiert sich dieses durch den Herrscher, er spricht es an im Dienst an ihm.</German>

		<Spanish>La monarqu&#237;a helen&#237;stica se apoy&#243; en una aristocracia creada por el propio rey y desarroll&#243; un car&#225;cter especialmente cosmopolita, muy lejos de la anterior nobleza solariega. En adelante el rey no ser&#237;a elegido libremente por sus ciudadanos. Los reyes helen&#237;sticos y sus nobles fueron elegidos por el propio rey pero para llevar a cabo con &#233;xito y ante el pueblo tal sistema, insistieron en la idea de la divinidad, es decir, el rey ten&#237;a derecho a gobernar y a seleccionar la nobleza porque su poder lo hab&#237;a obtenido a trav&#233;s de su linaje divino y porque &#233;l mismo era en cierto modo un dios. El paso siguiente fue iniciar el culto al rey.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Este sistema de divinizaci&#243;n fue m&#225;s pol&#237;tico que religioso y ten&#237;a sus antecedentes en el pensamiento griego anterior con ejemplos de veneraci&#243;n a h&#233;roes y otros personajes mortales que se convirtieron en deidades despu&#233;s de su muerte, como es el ejemplo de Asclepio y otras figuras menores que hab&#237;an sido jefes militares o fundadores de ciudades. La deificaci&#243;n o apoteosis en vida de los reyes helen&#237;sticos nunca o casi nunca fue un asunto puramente religioso o espiritual; nadie fue a rezar o a pedir gracias especiales a ninguno de estos personajes. Sin embargo fue necesario establecer el poder pol&#237;tico en seres considerados por sus s&#250;bditos como dioses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El culto al rey hab&#237;a empezado ya en la figura de Alejandro Magno que fue reconocido como un mortal realizador de grandes haza&#241;as y descendiente de Heracles, confirmado en el or&#225;culo de Siwa como hijo del propio Zeus-Am&#243;n. La deificaci&#243;n de Alejandro en vida le sirvi&#243; en muchas ocasiones como aprobaci&#243;n y reconocimiento legal de su poder real. El propio Alejandro se tomaba su deificaci&#243;n como algo muy serio. Despu&#233;s de su muerte muchas de las ciudades helen&#237;sticas siguieron este proceso, deificando a algunos de sus di&#225;docos, como ocurri&#243; con Demetrio Poliorcetes, Ant&#237;gono II G&#243;natas, Lis&#237;maco de Tracia, Casandro de Macedonia, Seleuco I Nic&#225;tor y Ptolomeo I.</Spanish>

		<German>Der Kaiserkult war eine kultische Verehrung der Kaiser des R&#246;mischen Reichs. Man brachte den toten oder lebenden Herrschern Opfer dar, betete ihr Bildnis an und machte sie dadurch zu einem Gottk&#246;nig. Der r&#246;mische Kaiserkult ist eine Sonderform des in der Antike verbreiteten Herrscherkults und ging auf den Makedonen Alexander den Gro&#223;en zur&#252;ck. Dieser, so glaubte man, wurde wegen seiner gro&#223;en Taten und Hilfe f&#252;r das Volk nach seinem Tod in die G&#246;ttergemeinschaft aufgenommen und leistete von dort aus seinen Verehrern weiterhin Hilfe. Nach ihm wurden weitere charismatische F&#252;hrer nach ihrem Tod verg&#246;ttlicht, sp&#228;ter auch Wohlt&#228;ter zu ihren Lebzeiten. Die R&#246;mer kamen aufgrund ihrer Eroberungen mit dem griechisch-hellenistischen Herrscherkult in Ber&#252;hrung, der der traditionellen r&#246;mischen Religion unbekannt war.

		<English>A warrior is a person skilled in combat or warfare, especially within the context of a tribal or clan-based society that recognizes a separate warrior class. In tribal societies engaging in endemic warfare, warriors often form a caste or class of their own. In feudalism, the vassals essentially form a military or warrior class, even if in actual warfare, peasants may be called to fight as well. In some societies, warfare may be so central that the entire people (or, more often, large parts of the male population) may be considered warriors, for example in the Iron Age Germanic tribes or the Medieval Rajput and Sikhs. Professional warriors are people who are paid money for engaging in military campaigns, and fall into one of two categories: Soldiers, when fighting on behalf of their own state; or mercenaries, when offering their services commercially and unrelated to their own nationality. The classification of somebody who is involved in acts of violence may be a matter of perspective, and there may be disagreement whether a given person is a "legitimate" combatant, or a hooligan, gangster, pirate, terrorist, rebel, brigand or bandit. In many societies in which a specialized warrior class exists, specific codes of conduct (ethical codes) are established to ensure that the warrior class is not corrupted or otherwise dangerous to the rest of society. Common features include valuing honour in the forms of faith, loyalty and courage. Warriors honour is dependent on following the code. Common virtues in warrior codes are mercy, courage and loyalty.</English>

		<German>In Stammesgesellschaften k&#228;mpfen die Krieger an der Seite ihrer Clan-Mitglieder und ihrer Verwandten. So berichtet Tacitus von den Germanen: "Besonders spornt sie zur Tapferkeit an, dass nicht Zufall und willk&#252;rliche Zusammenstellung, sondern Familien und Geschlechter die Reiterhaufen oder die Schlachtkeile bilden." Aus Stammeskriegern bestanden die Heerwesen jungsteinzeitlicher Kulturen bis hin zu den fr&#252;hen Griechen und Italern. Eine typische Stammesgesellschaft ist das Volk der Juden des Alten Testaments mit seinem Stammesgott, seiner Abstammung von den Patriarchen, seiner Gliederung in "St&#228;mme" und "Geschlechter", seinem heiligen Gesetz und einem Heer, in dem die Abteilungen nach St&#228;mmen organisiert waren. In der Ilias gibt der weise Nestor dem K&#246;nig Agamemnon den Rat: "Stelle das Heer nach Phylen und Phratrien auf, Agamemnon; so kann die Phyle der Phyle beistehen und die Phratrie der Phratrie.

In tribal societies engaging in endemic warfare, warriors often form a caste or class of their own. In feudalism, the vassals essentially form a military or warrior class, even if in actual warfare, peasants may be called to fight as well. In some societies, warfare may be so central that the entire people (or, more often, large parts of the male population) may be considered warriors, for example in the Iron Age Germanic tribes or the Medieval Rajput and Sikhs. Professional warriors are people who are paid money for engaging in military campaigns, and fall into one of two categories: Soldiers, when fighting on behalf of their own state; or mercenaries, when offering their services commercially and unrelated to their own nationality. The classification of somebody who is involved in acts of violence may be a matter of perspective, and there may be disagreement whether a given person is a "legitimate" combatant, or a hooligan, gangster, pirate, terrorist, rebel, brigand or bandit. In many societies in which a specialized warrior class exists, specific codes of conduct (ethical codes) are established to ensure that the warrior class is not corrupted or otherwise dangerous to the rest of society. Common features include valuing honour in the forms of faith, loyalty and courage. Warriors honour is dependent on following the code. Common virtues in warrior codes are mercy, courage and loyalty.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Un guerrero es una persona habitualmente involucrada en la guerra. En muchas sociedades tribales, los guerreros generalmente forman una casta o clase entre ellos. En el feudalismo, los vasallos esencialmente formaban una clase militar o guerrera, aunque en una guerra, los campesinos tambi&#233;n pueden ser llamados para pelear. En algunas sociedades, la guerra puede ser tan importante que la poblaci&#243;n entera (o m&#225;s a menudo una gran parte de poblaci&#243;n masculina) puede ser considerada guerrera como por ejemplo, las tribus germ&#225;nicas de la Edad de Hierro o de los Rajputs medievales de la India.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los guerreros profesionales son aquellos a los cuales se les paga dinero para que participen en campa&#241;as militares o en la defensa de fronteras nacionales. Estos pueden caer en una de las siguientes categor&#237;as: Soldados, cuando pelean en beneficio de su propio Estado; o Mercenarios, cuando ofrecen sus servicios comercialmente al mejor postor, independientemente de su nacionalidad o ideolog&#237;a.</Spanish>

		<English>A peasant militia is a form of military system, which emerged in agrarian nations. The conscript peasants only in case of need from the field called for military service and return, if they survive, returned after the end of the campaign on its soil. They had their arms and get themselves and were responsible for the quality of the equipment itself. The conscript was bound to a minimum capital in the form of property.

		<English>Conscription is the compulsory enrollment of people to some sort of public service, most often military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. Around the reign of Hammurabi (1792-1750 BCE), the Babylonian Empire used a system of conscription called Ilkum. Under the system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, those subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land per se but specific land supplied by the state. Various forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the Code of Hammurabi, the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.</English>

		<English>The Spartan army was one of the earliest professional armies, as men began training at the age of 7 and devoted their lives to war until retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose army had to disband during planting and harvest season, the Spartan serfs, or helots did the manual labour. This allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year. The Spartan army was largely composed of hoplites, equipped with arms and armour nearly identical to each other, each bearing the Spartan emblem and the colour scarlet. The Roman army was not the first professional army, using the best factors of the Spartan military. It had its origins in the citizen army of the Republic, which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. The reforms of Marius around 100 BC turned the army into a professional structure, still largely filled by citizens, but citizens who served continuously for 25 years before being discharged. The Romans were also noted for making use of auxiliary troops, non-Romans who served with the legions and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as light skirmish troops and heavy cavalry. Later in the Empire, these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman military. By the late Empire, tribes such as the Visigoths were paid to serve as mercenaries.</English>

		<English>Oppidum (plural oppida) is a Latin word meaning the main settlement in any administrative area of ancient Rome. The word is derived from the earlier Latin ob-pedum, "enclosed space," possibly from the Proto-Indo-European *pedm-, "occupied space" or "footprint." Julius Caesar described the larger Celtic Iron Age settlements he encountered in Gaul as oppida, and the term is now used to describe the large pre-Roman towns that existed all across Western and Central Europe. Many oppida grew from hill forts, although by no means did all of them have significant defensive functions. Oppida surrounded by earthworks are known as enclosed oppida. The main features of the oppida are the architectural construction of the walls and gates, the spacious layout and commanding view of the surrounding area. The development of oppida was a milestone in the urbanisation of the continent as they were the first large settlements north of the Mediterranean that could genuinely be described as towns. Caesar pointed out that each tribe of Gaul would have several oppida but that they were not all of equal importance, perhaps implying some form of hierarchy. In conquered lands, the Romans used the infrastructure of the oppida to administer the empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain.</English>

Jahrhunderts wurden die drei Geb&#228;ude des Kapitolsplatzes (der Senatorenpalast, der Konservatorenpalast und der Palazzo Nuovo) durch einen unterirdischen Gang verbunden. Dabei wurden bedeutende Reste des ehemaligen Tabulariums f&#252;r die &#214;ffentlichkeit zug&#228;nglich gemacht, die diese im Zusammenhang mit einem Besuch des Kapitolinischen Museums besichtigen k&#246;nnen. Teil der originalen antiken Bausubstanz ist auch ein Klostergew&#246;lbe &#252;ber quadratischem Grundriss, eines der fr&#252;hesten nachweisbaren Beispiele dieser Kuppelform.</German>
		<Italian>The Tabularium was the official records office of ancient Rome, and also housed the offices of many city officials. Situated within the Roman Forum, it was on the front slope of the Capitoline Hill, below the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, to the southeast of the Arx and Tarpeian Rock. The interior Within the building were the remains of the temple of Veiovis. In front of it were the Temples of Vespasian &#38; Concord, as well as the Rostra and the rest of the forum. Presently the Tabularium is only accessible from within the Capitoline Museum, although it still affords an excellent panoramic view over the Forum. The Tabularium was first constructed around 78 BC, by order of M. Aemilius Lepidus and Q. Lutatius Catulus. It was later restored and renovated during the reign of the Emperor Claudius, about 46 AD.</Italian>

		<English>Glassblowing is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble, or parison, with the aid of a blowpipe, or blow tube. A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith, or gaffer. Glassblowing was invented by the Phoenicians at approximately 50 BC somewhere along the Syro-Palestinian coast. The earliest evidence of glassblowing comes from a collection of waste from a glass workshop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a mikvah, a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of Old City of Jerusalem dated from 37 to 4 BC. Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form small bottle, thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe. Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of glass. Such invention swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as casting and core-forming, in working glass. The invention of glassblowing coincided with the establishment of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC which served to provide motivation to its spread and dominance. Glassblowing was greatly encouraged under the Roman rule, although Roman citizens could not be "in trade", in particular under the reign of Augustus, therefore glass was being blown in many areas of the Roman world. On the eastern borders of the Empire, the first glass workshops were set up by the Phoenicians in the birthplace of glassblowing in contemporary Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine, as well as in the neighbouring province of Cyprus. Ennion for example, was among one of the most prominent glassworkers from Lebanon of the time. He was renowned for producing the multi-paneled mould-blown glass vessels that were complex in their shapes, arrangement and decorative motifs. The complexity of designs of these mould-blown glass vessels illustrated that the sophistication of the glassworkers in the eastern regions of the Roman Empire. Mould-blown glass vessels manufactured by the workshops of Ennion and other contemporary glassworkers such as Jason, Nikon, Aristeas and Meges, constitutes some of the earliest evidence of glassblowing found in the eastern territories. Meanwhile, the glassblowing technique reached Egypt and was described in a fragmentary poem printed on the papyrus which was dated to 3rd century AD. Besides, the Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of Hellenistic casting, core-forming and mosaic fusion techniques by blowing. The earliest evidence of blowing in Hellenistic consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved from the glass workshops on the Greek island of Samothrace and at Corinth in mainland Greece which were dated to 1st century AD On the other hand, the Phoenician glassworkers exploited their glassblowing techniques and set up their workshops in the western territories of the Roman Empire first in Italy by the middle of the 1st century AD Rome, the heartland of the Empire, soon became a major glassblowing centre and more glassblowing workshops were subsequently established in other provinces of Italy, for example Campania, Morgantina and Aquileia. A great variety of blown glass objects, ranging from unguentaria (toiletry container for perfume) to cameo, from tableware to window glass, were produced. From there, escaping craftsmen forbidden to travel otherwise advanced to the rest of Europe by building their glassblowing workshops in the north of the Alps which is now Switzerland and then at sites in northern Europe in present-day France and Belgium. Surviving evidence, such as blowpipes and moulds which are indicative of the presence of blowing, was fragmentary and limited. Fragments of clay blowpipes were retrieved from the late 1st century AD glass workshop at Avenches in Switzerland. Clay blowpipes, also known as mouthblowers, were made by the ancient glassworkers due to the accessibility and availability of the resources before the introduction of the metal blowpipes. Hollow iron rods, together with blown vessel fragments and glass waste dating to approximately 4th century AD, were recovered from the glass workshop in Merida of Spain, as well as in Salona in Croatia. Meanwhile, one of the most prolific glassblowing centres of the Roman period was established in Cologne on the river Rhine in Germany by late 1st century BC. Stone base mould and terracotta base mould were discovered from these Rhineland workshops suggesting the adoption and the application of mould-blowing technique by the glassworkers. Besides, blown flagons and blown jars decorated with ribbing, as well as blown perfume bottles with letters CCAA or CCA which stand for Colonia Claudia Agrippiniensis, were produced from the Rhineland workshops. Remains of blown blue-green glass vessels, for example bottles with a handle, collared bowls and indented beakers, were found in abundance from the local glass workshops at Poetovio and Celeia in Slovenia.</English>

		<English>Trading vessels, also known as "coastal trading vessels" or "coasters", are shallow-hulled ships used for trade between locations on the same island or continent. Their shallow hulls mean that they can get through reefs where deeper-hulled sea-going ships usually cannot. A wide variety of sources teach us about ancient Mediterranean trade. Written history by peoples surrounding the Mediterranean Sea go back to the third millennium b.c. We hear about trade relations from Mesopotamian monarchs, Egyptian pharaohs, biblical kings, Greek adventurers and historians, Roman bureaucrats, and Phoenician sailors. For example, the wisdom literature of Egypt contains the eleventh-century b.c. tale of the woeful Wen Amun, who suffers many misadventures when sent by his pharaoh to procure timber from the Levantine coast. The biblical Book of Kings provides documentary evidence of the trade of tenth-century b.c. King Solomon, who exchanged Israelite grain for the Phoenician lumber of King Hiram of Tyre. Among the stories of the Greek historian Herodotus is the tale of the Samian Colaeus, the first Greek to trade with the Tarsessos colonies in Spain, a man who was greatly honored for his feat upon his return to Samos. Unfortunately, little documentary evidence comes from the traders themselves. This is largely due to the nature of the written recordmost trading documents in ancient times were on perishable materials that have not been preserved. Equally useful are pictorial records of trading parties. Some, like the fifteenth-century b.c. Kenaumun tomb from Thebes, Egypt, carefully depict the unloading of the cargo of slaves and wine from a ship from distant Canaan.</English>

		<English>Rorarii were soldiers which formed the final lines, or else provided a reserve thereby, in the ancient pre-Marian Roman army. They may have been used with the triarii in battle near the final stages of fighting, since they are recorded as being located at the rear of the main battle formation. (Note that the saying "Going to the Triarii" means that something has gone to the bitter end-as in reached the final line.) They may have been similar in role to the accensi, acting as supernumeraries and filling the places of fallen soldiers as a battle or campaign wore on, or they may have been skirmishers akin to velites.

It seems most likely that they were not part of the line in the same way as triarii, principes and hastati were.</English>

It seems most likely that they were not part of the line in the same way as triarii, principes and hastati were.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Rorarii were soldiers which formed the final lines, or else provided a reserve thereby, in the ancient pre-Marian Roman army. They may have been used with the triarii in battle near the final stages of fighting, since they are recorded as being located at the rear of the main battle formation.

		<English>Velites (singular: veles) were a class of infantry in the Polybian legions of the early Roman republic. Velites were light infantry and skirmishers who were armed with a number of light javelins, or hastae velitares, to fling at the enemy, and also carried short thrusting swords, or gladii for use in melee. They rarely wore armour, as they were the youngest and poorest soldiers in the legion and could not afford much equipment. They did carry small wooden shields for protection though, and wore a headdress made from wolf skin to allow officers to differentiate between them and other heavier legionaries. Velites did not form their own units; a number of them were attached to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They were typically used as a screening force, driving off enemy skirmishers and disrupting enemy formations with javelin throws before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier armed hastati to attack. They were normally the ones who engaged war elephants and chariots if they were present on the field; their high mobility and ranged weaponry made them much more effective against these enemies than heavy infantry. An early Roman legion contained approximately 1,000 velites. Velites were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms. Velites were the youngest and usually the poorest soldiers in the legion, and could rarely afford much equipment. They were armed with hastae velitares, light javelins with tips designed to bend on impact to prevent it being thrown back, similar to the heavier pila of other legionaries. As backup weapons, they also carried gladii, relatively short thrusting swords 74 centimetres (29 inches) in length that were the main weapons of the hastati and principes. They fought in a very loose, staggered formation like most irregular troops and carried small round shields, 90 cm (3 feet) in diameter. In the legion, the velites were attached to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They usually formed up at the front of the legion before battle to harass the enemy with javelin throws and to prevent the enemy doing the same before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier infantry to attack. In a pitched battle, the velites would form up at the front of the legion and harass the enemy with javelin throws and cover the advance of the hastati, who were armed with swords, and were the first line of attack. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back and let the principes, similarly equipped though more experienced infantry, take over. If the principes failed, they would retire behind the triarii, heavily armoured, spear armed legionaries and let them carry on. Velites were descended from an earlier class of light infantry, leves, dating from the Camillan legion of the 5th century BC, who had a very similar role to the velites. They were also the poorer and younger soldiers in the legion, though the rorarii and accensi classes were considerably poorer and were eventually done away with, having insufficient equipment to be effective soldiers. Leves were likewise armed with a number of javelins, but carried a spear rather than a sword. Like the velites, leves did not have their own units, but were attached to units of hastati. Velites were first used at the siege of Capua in 211 BC, and were made up of citizens who would normally be too poor to join the hastati but where called up due a shortage of manpower. They were trained to ride on horseback with the Equites and jump down at a given signal to fling javelins at the enemy. After the siege, they were adopted into the legions as a force of irregular light infantry for ambushing and harassing the enemy with javelins before the battle began in earnest. With the formal military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, designed to combat a shortage of manpower due to wars against Jugurtha, the different classes of units were done away with entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Now soldiers would join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as medium infantry with the same, state purchased equipment. Auxilliae, local irregular troops, would now be used to fulfill other roles such as archery, skirmishing and flanking.</English>

		<German>Die Velites (Singular: veles, deutsch: Pl&#228;nkler) waren eine Formation in der r&#246;mischen Republik. Sie stand noch im ersten Treffen vor den Hastati, und begann die Schlacht, meistens durch ein Gepl&#228;nkel mit den feindlichen Speerwerfern. Die Velites bestanden aus etwa 1.200 Mann, die einer Legion beigegeben und in der Schlachtordnung den einzelnen Manipeln zugeteilt wurden. Ihre Bewaffnung bestand aus einem spanischen Kurzschwert (gladius hispanicum), einer Kappe aus Leder oder Fellen, einer Anzahl (gew&#246;hnlich sieben) Wurfspeeren (hastae velitares) und einem kleinen runden Schild (parma). Titus Livius berichtet, dass die Formation der Velites ab 211 v. Chr. w&#228;hrend der Belagerung von Capua im Zweiten Punischen Krieg an die Stelle der &#228;lteren Rorarii traten. Nach der neuen Heeresordnung durch Marius Ende des 2. Jahrhunderts verschwand sie wieder.

		<English>Hastati (singular: Hastatus) were a class of infantry in the armies of the early Roman Republic who originally fought as spearmen, and later as swordsmen. They were originally some of the poorest men in the legion, and could afford only modest equipment light armour and a large shield, in their service as the lighter infantry of the legion. Later, the hastati contained the younger men rather than just the poorer, though most men of their age were relatively poor. Their usual position was the first battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by light troops. They were eventually done away with after the Marian reforms of 107 BC. Hastati appear to have been remnants of the old third class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The third class stood in some of the last few ranks of a very large phalanx were equipped in a similar manner to hastati, but more often than not were relegated to providing missile support to the higher classes rather than fighting themselves. It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat at the hands of the Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy. By the 4th century BC the military the Romans had inherited from the Etruscans was still in use. Though its efficiency was doubtful, it proved effective against Romes largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full scale attack on Rome. The entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia in a crushing defeat that prompted reforms by Marcus Furius Camillus. Under the new system, men were sorted into classes based on wealth; the hastati were the third poorest, with the rorarii being slightly poorer and the principes slightly wealthier. Hastati were armed with short spears, or hastae, up to 1.8 metres (6 ft) long, from which the soldiers acquired their name. They fought in quincunx formation, usually carrying scuta, large rectangular shields, and bronze helmets, often with a number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature. They wore light armour, the most common form being small breastplates, called "heart protectors". In this type of legion, the 900 hastati formed 15 maniples, military units of 60 men each. Attached to each maniple were about 20 leves, javelin-armed light infantry. The hastati stood in the first battle line, in front of the principes of the second line and the triarii of the third. In a pitched battle, the leves would form up at the front of the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy during their engagement, they would fall back and let the heavier principes take over. If the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii spearmen, who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line were some of the least dependable troops, and were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line. By the time of the Punic wars of the 3rd century BC, the Camillan system of organisation was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the hastati being the youngest and least experienced. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each hastatus also carried 2 pila, heavy javelins that, "contrary to deeply entrenched myth" (Goldsworthy), did not bend on impact to make any struck shield useless or prevent the weapon from being thrown back. The weight and barb alone sufficiently hampered any struck shield (often penetrating the shield to hit the man behind it), and the iron was sufficiently hard that pila were often used as hand-held spears against both infantry and cavalry. By the time the volley of pila had reached the enemy line (usually only 15 yards distant for best effect), the legionaries were charging and very quickly at work with their swords. There was rarely any time for the foe to find a pilum, pull it out of whatever it had hit and throw it back. The hastati had been increased in number to 1200 per legion, and formed 10 maniples of 120 men each. The rorarii and accensi had been done away with. Leves had been replaced with velites, who had a similar role but were now also attached to principes and triarii. Pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion; the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back on the principes, who had also been re-armed with swords. If the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy. This order of battle was almost always followed, the battle of the Great Plains and the battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions. At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed his men up in the usual manner, but once the hastati had begun to engage the enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a flanking force, routing the opposing Carthaginian troops. At Zama, Scipio arranged his men into columns, side by side, with large lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, he formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry With the formal military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat a shortage of manpower from wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were done away with entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Soldiers would join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as medium infantry with the same state-purchased equipment.

In a pitched battle, the leves would form up at the front of the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy during their engagement, they would fall back and let the heavier principes take over. If the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii spearmen, who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line were some of the least dependable troops, and were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line. By the time of the Punic wars of the 3rd century BC, the Camillan system of organisation was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the hastati being the youngest and least experienced. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each hastatus also carried 2 pila, heavy javelins that, "contrary to deeply entrenched myth" (Goldsworthy), did not bend on impact to make any struck shield useless or prevent the weapon from being thrown back. The weight and barb alone sufficiently hampered any struck shield (often penetrating the shield to hit the man behind it), and the iron was sufficiently hard that pila were often used as hand-held spears against both infantry and cavalry. By the time the volley of pila had reached the enemy line (usually only 15 yards distant for best effect), the legionaries were charging and very quickly at work with their swords. There was rarely any time for the foe to find a pilum, pull it out of whatever it had hit and throw it back. The hastati had been increased in number to 1200 per legion, and formed 10 maniples of 120 men each. The rorarii and accensi had been done away with. Leves had been replaced with velites, who had a similar role but were now also attached to principes and triarii. Pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion; the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back on the principes, who had also been re-armed with swords. If the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy. This order of battle was almost always followed, the battle of the Great Plains and the battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions. At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed his men up in the usual manner, but once the hastati had begun to engage the enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a flanking force, routing the opposing Carthaginian troops. At Zama, Scipio arranged his men into columns, side by side, with large lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, he formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry With the formal military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat a shortage of manpower from wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were done away with entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Soldiers would join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as medium infantry with the same state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Los asteros (en lat&#237;n, hastati y en singular, hastatus, que puede traducirse literalmente como lancero o luchador con lanza) eran una clase de infanter&#237;a en los ej&#233;rcitos de la Rep&#250;blica Romana. Eran los hombres m&#225;s j&#243;venes y pobres de la legi&#243;n, los cuales s&#243;lo pod&#237;an permitirse equipos modestos, para cumplir con su labor como la infanter&#237;a ligera. Estas unidades se disolvieron tras las reformas de Mario de 107 a. C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eran las tropas de primera l&#237;nea de la legi&#243;n de la &#233;poca republicana. Estaban equipados con una armadura ligera y un escudo largo (scutum). A una orden, golpeaban los escudos con las jabalinas, comenzaban a desplazarse al frente, hasta encontrarse a unos 64 metros del enemigo. En ese momento comenzaban un trote r&#225;pido, lanzaban sus pila (jabalinas) y desenfundaban las espadas mientras segu&#237;an avanzando para el combate cuerpo a cuerpo. Peleaban en una formaci&#243;n de quincunx, apoyados por otras tropas ligeras (equites y v&#233;lites).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A partir de la segunda guerra p&#250;nica, se tiene constancia de que usaban las espadas romanas conocidas como gladius &#8211; llamada por los romanos espada hispana (gladius hispaniensis), ya que su dise&#241;o estaba basado en la gladius hispaniensis tras las guerras Celt&#237;beras &#8211; era un arma particularmente efectiva, capaz de causar heridas tanto de estocada (que, parece ser, era su uso principal) como de corte. Ir&#243;nicamente, el nombre de los asteros viene de la palabra latina hasta (lanza) arma que no utilizaban, aunque en los principios de la rep&#250;blica combat&#237;an como lanceros. Esta unidad militar estaba formada por tropas j&#243;venes que deb&#237;an pagarse su propio equipo, por tanto su equipamiento era de calidad relativamente pobre.</Spanish>

		<English>Principes (Singular: Princeps) were spearmen, and later swordsmen, in the armies of the early Roman Republic. They were men in the prime of their lives who were fairly wealthy, and could afford decent equipment. They were the heavier infantry of the legion who carried large shields and wore good quality armour. Their usual position was the second battle line. They fought in quincunx formation, supported by light troops. They were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms of 107 BC. Principes appear to have been born remnants of the old second class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The second class stood in some of the first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes. They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks. It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat at the hands of the Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.</English>

		<English>Triarii (Singular: Triarius) were one of the elements of the early Roman military Manipular legions of the early Roman Republic (509 BC 107 BC). They were the oldest and among the wealthiest men in the army, and could afford good quality equipment. They wore heavy metal armour and carried large shields, their usual position being the third battle line. During the Camillan era, they fought in a shallow phalanx formation, supported by light troops. In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They were meant to be used as a decisive force in the battle, thus prompting an old Roman saying: Going to the triarii (res ad triarios venit), which meant carrying on to the bitter end. They were eventually phased out after the Marian reforms of 107 BC. Triarii may have evolved from the old first class of the army under the Etruscan kings. The first class comprised the richest soldiers in the legion who were equipped with spears, breastplates and large shields, like heavy Greek hoplites. They served as heavy infantry in the early Roman army, and were used at the front of a very large phalanx formation. After a time, engagements with the Samnites and Gauls appear to have taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy. With the formal military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, implemented to combat a shortage of manpower due to wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were scrapped entirely. The wealth and age requirements were removed; anyone could join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and all would be equipped as milites, with the same, state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry. Sallust, in his Jugurthine War, describes several instances in which Roman or allied regular heavy infantry were equipped with light equipment and used as light footsoldiers. This was supposedly a common practice.</English>
		<French>Les Triarii (Singulier : Triarius) sont la troisi&#232;me (tri = trois) et derni&#232;re ligne disponible dans les l&#233;gions r&#233;publicaines, organis&#233;e en dix cohortes contenant chacune trois manipules de 160 hommes, chacune divis&#233;e en deux centuries de 80 soldats.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ce sont des soldats avec un armement plus lourd que les simples l&#233;gionnaires, et de meilleure qualit&#233;. Ils poss&#232;dent une longue lance ("hasta" en latin), un grand bouclier incurv&#233; anc&#234;tre du scutum, ainsi qu'un glaive ("gladius"), mais sont form&#233;s en phalange, ce qui les rend aptes &#224; repousser les charges de cavalerie.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]C'&#233;taient les soldats les plus vieux et les plus exp&#233;riment&#233;s, disposant de plus de moyens financiers pour payer leur &#233;quipement. Ils formaient donc la derni&#232;re rang&#233;e de soldats, et restaient en retrait la plupart du temps pendant la bataille, &#224; genou, se contentant parfois de garder le camp. Le recours aux triarii &#233;tait synonyme de la d&#233;faite ou de l'&#233;chec des deux premiers rangs d'infanterie lourde de la l&#233;gion r&#233;publicaine, les hastati et les principes, donc d'une situation difficile sinon d&#233;sesp&#233;r&#233;e. Les deux premiers rangs se regroupaient alors autour de la puissante phalange et tentaient une ultime contre-attaque ou se pr&#233;paraient &#224; retarder l'ennemi pour faciliter la retraite. Ils chargeaient au plus fort du combat. En latin, res ad triarios rediit "aller aux triarii" ou "en arriver &#224; recourir aux triarii" signifiait entrer dans le vif du sujet, devoir recourir aux grands moyens.</French>
		<German>Triarier (lat. triarii die Dritten), mitunter auch Triarer, waren die Elite der r&#246;mischen Legion. Zun&#228;chst definierte sich die Zugeh&#246;rigkeit zu den Triariern nur &#252;ber das Einkommen, da im Rahmen der Wehrpflicht nur Wohlhabende die n&#246;tigen Mittel hatten, sich die aufw&#228;ndigen R&#252;stungen und Waffen zu kaufen. In der Fr&#252;hzeit des r&#246;mischen Reiches &#228;hnelten die Triarier in ihrer Ausr&#252;stung sehr den griechischen Hopliten. Zu dieser Zeit stellten sie nur etwa ein F&#252;nftel der schweren Infanterie. Nachdem die Einteilung nach Einkommensklassen im 2. Jahrhundert v. Chr. aufgegeben wurde, waren sie grunds&#228;tzlich wie die anderen Abteilungen der Legion mit Speeren (Pilum), Turmschild (Scutum), Dolch und Kurzschwert (Gladius, sp&#228;ter h&#228;ufiger das Langschwert Spatha) bewaffnet (zeitweise auch mit der Hasta), jedoch meist in besserer Qualit&#228;t und stellten nun ein Drittel der Legion. Sie besa&#223;en aber weiterhin ein hohes Prestige als erfahrene Veteranen und verliehen der gestaffelten Aufstellung der Legion R&#252;ckhalt. Sie standen im dritten Treffen, den letzten Reihen der r&#246;mischen Schlachtordnung, was ihnen ihre Bezeichnung verlieh. Oft wurden sie aber auch ehrenvoll als Pili bezeichnet.</German>

		<English>Eques were light, unarmoured Roman horsemen. In Classical Antiquity, most armies consisted of infantry. Horsemen were only employed to escort troops or at the end of battles, to attack and protect refugees. The real fighting was done by infantry. Still, ancient armies needed cavalry, and the horsemen usually belonged to the highest classes, because no one else could afford a horse. After all, horses needed to eat but were rather useless because no one knew how harness them to a cart or plow, and as the stirrup had not yet been invented, it took a lot of time to learn to ride. Consequently, it was prestigious to own and ride a horse: you could show that you were rich and did not have to work. Archaic Rome was probably no exception to this rule, although it is a bit puzzling that the horsemen received financial compensation to buy a horse (the equus publicus, "horse bought by the commonwealth"). Why should the rich be subsidized? A possible explanation is that Rome needed a lot of horsemen and had only a few rich people; alternatively, the rich had found a way to become even richer. After the defeat of Alba Longa, and the removal of its citizens to Rome, King Tullus Hostilius added ten turmae of Albans (totalling an additional 300 men) to the ranks of the equites. The equites were doubled in size by King Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (conventional dates 616-578 BC). After an attack on Rome by the Sabines, Tarquinius Priscus determined that Romes military weakness lay in its lack of horsemen.</English>

After the defeat of Alba Longa, and the removal of its citizens to Rome, King Tullus Hostilius added ten turmae of Albans (totalling an additional 300 men) to the ranks of the equites. The equites were doubled in size by King Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (conventional dates 616-578 BC). After an attack on Rome by the Sabines, Tarquinius Priscus determined that Romes military weakness lay in its lack of horsemen.</Italian>

		<English>The Roman army used some auxiliaries who were not so well trained. These were called numeri (the plural form of numerus, literally "number"). The numeri were small groups of half-savage tribesmen, using their own weapons and commanded by their own chiefs. Their orders would be given in their own language, not Latin. Numeri were used as border scouts. Romans did not think they were very valuable and tried to use them first when the enemy attacked.</English>

		<German>Als Numerus (lateinisch numerus, Plural numeri; w&#246;rtlich: Zahl, sinngem&#228;&#223;: Einheit) wurde eine kleine, aber meist selbstst&#228;ndig operierende Auxiliartruppen-Einheit des r&#246;mischen Heeres bezeichnet. Numerus bezeichnet in der r&#246;mischen Milit&#228;rorganisation zun&#228;chst eine nicht n&#228;her definierte Einheit der Armee. In weiterer Folge etablierte sich dieser Begriff ab dem 2. Jahrhundert f&#252;r kleinere Einheiten, die oft auch von Barbarenst&#228;mmen angeworben wurden. Numerus bedeutete urspr&#252;nglich die Schar, das hei&#223;t, solche Einheiten wurden nur im Bedarfsfall ausgehoben und nach Beendigung ihres Einsatzes wieder aufgel&#246;st. In sp&#228;terer Zeit wandelten sich aber auch diese Truppen zu stehenden Verb&#228;nden. Sie z&#228;hlten zu den r&#246;mischen Hilfstruppen, waren aber nicht so gut gedrillt wie die Auxilia, die regul&#228;rer Bestandteil des r&#246;mischen Heeres waren. Ihre Angeh&#246;rigen wurden als peregrini (= Fremde, nicht im Besitz des r&#246;mischen B&#252;rgerrechtes) angeworben und dienten zur Unterst&#252;tzung der Grenztruppen. Sie unterschieden sich auch in Bezug auf ihre Bewaffnung und Organisation nicht wesentlich von der regul&#228;ren Truppe. Ihre Rechtstellung und Prestige lag aber noch unter den Auxiliaren. Anscheinend erhielten die Numeri auch nach ihrer Entlassung aus dem aktiven Dienst nicht automatisch das r&#246;mische B&#252;rgerrecht.</German>

		<Spanish>A partir del siglo II surgen en el panorama militar romano nuevas unidades conocidas como numerus (grupo, numeri en plural) y vexillatio (destacamento). El n&#250;mero de hombres que compon&#237;an estos cuerpos se desconoce, aunque se supone menor que el de las alae y las cohortes. Antiguamente, los estudiosos defendieron que estos nuevos cuerpos eran simples regimientos reclutados entre los pueblos extranjeros a fin de defender sus tierras, pero en la actualidad se piensa que formaban parte de las unidades auxiliares, y no que constituyeran un cuerpo independiente. Los numerus y los vexillatio alcanzaron gran importancia en el siglo IV.</Spanish>

		<English>The cohortes urbanae (Latin meaning urban cohorts) of ancient Rome were created by Augustus to counterbalance the enormous power of the Praetorian Guard in the city of Rome and serve as a police force. They were led by the urban prefect. Their primary role was to police Rome and to counteract the roaming mobs and gangs that so often haunted its streets during the Republic. The urban cohorts thus acted as a heavy duty police force, capable of riot control duties, while their contemporaries, the Vigiles, had the day-to-day role of policing the streets and protecting against fires. As a trained paramilitary organization, the urban cohorts could, on rare occasions, take to the field of battle if necessary. This role, however, was only called upon in dire situations. Originally the cohortes urbanae were divided into three cohorts, each cohort being commanded by one tribune and six centurions. In the time of the Flavians this was increased to four cohorts. Each cohort contained around five hundred men. Only free citizens were eligible to serve in their ranks. As with the Praetorians, the men of the Urban cohorts were predominantly of Italian stock. Urban cohorts, (known as city cohorts in non roman cities) were later created in both the Roman north African city of Carthage and the city of Lyon, France, known to the Romans as Gaul.</English>

		<German>Die Cohortes urbanae (lateinisch: st&#228;dtische Kohorten) waren eine Einheit der r&#246;mischen Armee, die w&#228;hrend der Kaiserzeit in Rom und einigen weiteren St&#228;dten stationiert war und dort polizeiliche Aufgaben erf&#252;llte. Unter Augustus wurden zun&#228;chst drei Kohorten aufgestellt, deren Nummerierung (XXII) an die der Pr&#228;torianer anschloss. Im Gegensatz zu dieser Gardeeinheit unterstanden die Cohortes urbanae nicht dem Pr&#228;torianerpr&#228;fekten, sondern dem Praefectus urbi, dem Stadtpr&#228;fekten. Sie waren allerdings seit Tiberius bis zur Zeit Aurelians gemeinsam mit den Pr&#228;torianern in deren Lager (Castra praetoria) am Rande der Stadt untergebracht. Die Cohortes urbanae standen vom Ansehen her zwischen den Pr&#228;torianern und der dritten in Rom stationierten Truppe, den Vigiles. Die Zahl der Kohorten wurde bis zum Ende der julisch-claudischen Dynastie auf neun erh&#246;ht, von denen im Jahr 68 drei nicht in Rom, sondern in anderen St&#228;dten (Ostia, Puteoli, Lugdunum) stationiert waren. Die Kohorte von Lugdunum war in erster Linie f&#252;r die Bewachung einer kaiserlichen M&#252;nzst&#228;tte verantwortlich, die Augustus dort gegr&#252;ndet hatte.

Su numeraci&#243;n segu&#237;a a las de las Cohortes Pretorianas, por lo que su numeraci&#243;n correspond&#237;a con los n&#250;meros X, XI y XII, y estaban acuarteladas junto a estas en el Castra Praetoria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Adem&#225;s, en Lugdunum (Lyon, Francia) y Carthago en el &#193;frica Proconsular exist&#237;an sendas Cohortes Urbanas, para custodiar en el primer caso la importante ceca imperial de esta ciudad de la Galia, y en el segundo para garantizar el orden en la segunda ciudad occidental del Imperio. La cohorte de Lugdunum ten&#237;a el n&#250;mero I y la de Carthago el XIII.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las cohortes Urbanas estaban formadas por soldados de &#233;lite, reclutados por sus excelentes habilidades marciales y su lealtad, exclusivamente en Italia hasta &#233;poca de Septimio Severo. Su tiempo de servicio era de s&#243;lo 16 a&#241;os. Se trataba de infanter&#237;a pesada, aunque estaba destinada a mantener el orden dentro de la ciudad de Roma, y en contadas ocasiones combati&#243; de forma regular.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cada cohorte estaba mandada por un Tribunus Cohortis Urbanae procedente de Ordo Equester, muchas veces extra&#237;do de los antiguos centuriones primopilos de las legiones. Cada cohorte estaba dividida en centurias, al mando cada una de ellas de un centurio, asistido por un optio, un signifer, un tesserarius y varios duplicarii.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las cohortes urbanas estaban provistas del mismo equipo que los legionarios: Llevaban una armadura de bandas, la lorica segmentata, un casco de metal y un escudo grande. Combat&#237;an con dos pila (plural de pilum), lanzas arrojadizas con mangos de hierro blando dise&#241;adas para doblarse al impactar, de forma que fuera imposible sacarlas y devolverlas. Tambi&#233;n llevaban espadas cortas para el combate cuerpo a cuerpo. Sin embargo, su entrenamiento era inferior al de los pretorianos y al de los legionarios, ya que eran m&#225;s una fuerza de prestigio que una unidad de combate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Como diferencia de otros cuerpos, debido a su condici&#243;n de fuerza "policial" se les doto de varas de madera a modo de porras, y de cascabeles, sujetos al cintur&#243;n, a modo de sirena.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Vitelio, en 69, amplio su n&#250;mero hasta 7 y sus efectivo hasta 1500 infantes por cohorte, completando sus efectivos con veteranos de sus legiones del limes renano.

		<English>The history of glassmaking can be traced back to 3500 BCE in Mesopotamia. Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or Old Kingdom Egypt. Because of Egypts favorable environment for preservation, the majority of well-studied early glass is found there, although some of this is likely to have been imported. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid third millennium BCE, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing. During the Late Bronze Age in Egypt (e.g., the Ahhotep "Treasure") and Western Asia (e.g. Megiddo) there was a rapid growth in glass-making technology. Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass ingots, vessels (often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized hardstone carvings in semi-precious stones) and the ubiquitous beads. The alkali of Syrian and Egyptian glass was soda ash, sodium carbonate, which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants, notably halophile seashore plants. The earliest vessels were core-wound, produced by winding a ductile rope of glass round a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod, then fusing it with repeated reheatings. Threads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of oxides were subsequently wound around these to create patterns, which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools. The vessel would then be rolled flat (marvered) on a slab in order to press the decorative threads into its body. Handles and feet were applied separately. The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly annealed and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel, after which the core material was scraped out. Glass shapes for inlays were also often created in moulds. Much early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state. According to Pliny the Elder, Phoenician traders were the first to stumble upon glass manufacturing techniques at the site of the Belus River.</English>

		<German>Ob die Glasherstellung in Mesopotamien, in &#196;gypten oder an der Levantek&#252;ste erfunden wurde, l&#228;sst sich nicht mit letzter Gewissheit sagen. Die &#228;ltesten bekannten Glasobjekte sind Perlen und Amulette. Glasgef&#228;&#223;e sind nicht vor 1500 v. Chr. nachgewiesen. Handwerker aus Asien haben wahrscheinlich die Glasherstellung nach &#196;gypten gebracht, wo die ersten Gef&#228;&#223;e aus der Zeit von Thutmosis III. (1504-1450 v. Chr.) datieren. Die Glaserzeugung erlebte in &#196;gypten und Mesopotamien bis etwa 1200 v. Chr. eine erste Bl&#252;te. Da die &#196;gypter die Technik des Glasblasens noch nicht kannten, konnten sie lediglich kleine Gef&#228;&#223;e herstellen, die zur Aufbewahrung von Salben und Essenzen dienten. Glasgegenst&#228;nde galten als ausgesprochene Luxusartikel, da sie in einem schwierigen Verfahren gefertigt werden mussten. Der Herstellungsort dieses fr&#252;hesten Glases ist allerdings unbekannt, er wird in Theben, dem heutigen Luxor vermutet. Die bekannteste Verarbeitungstechnik beruht auf dem Herstellen von Hohlgef&#228;&#223;en durch das Wickeln von erweichten Glasst&#228;bchen um einen por&#246;sen Keramikkern, der anschlie&#223;end herausgekratzt wurde.

		<English>The plough (American spelling: plow) is a tool used in farming for initial cultivation of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, and represents one of the major advances in agriculture. The primary purpose of ploughing is to turn over the upper layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while burying weeds and the remains of previous crops, allowing them to break down. It also aerates the soil, and allows it to hold moisture better. Ploughs were initially pulled by oxen, and later in many areas by horses (generally draught horses) and mules. In industrialised countries, the first mechanical means of pulling a plough used steam-powered (ploughing engines or steam tractors), but these were gradually superseded by internal-combustion-powered tractors.</English>

Die fr&#252;heste Methode, den Boden aufzulockern, war der noch heute in vielen Teilen der Welt verwendete Grabstock. Das Auflockern des Erdreichs mit Hacke oder Dechsel erfolgte nur auf kleinen Fl&#228;chen. Der fr&#252;heste Fund eines Pfluges stammt aus der Schweiz und datiert in die Mitte des 5. Jahrtausends. Der &#228;lteste Pflug bestanden aus einem zugespitzten Holz, das den Boden aufriss und hatten weder Pflugschar, Sech, Wendebrett oder R&#228;der. Solche Pfl&#252;ge hielten sich in Mitteleuropa bis ins sp&#228;te Mittelalter. Zun&#228;chst zogen Rinder, also K&#252;he oder Ochsen den Pflug. Sehr viel sp&#228;ter kamen Esel, Kamel oder Maultiere hinzu, letztlich &#252;bernahmen dies in Mitteleuropa meist die leistungsf&#228;higeren Pferde. Im 4. Jahrhundert n. Chr. kam der R&#228;derpflug auf, dieser konzentriert die Zugleistung des Tieres mehr auf das Aufbrechen des Bodens statt auf das Ziehen des recht schweren Ger&#228;tes. Die Verwendung von Pferden zum Pfl&#252;gen wurde mit der Erfindung des Kummets besonders effektiv, denn der noch bis zum 8. Jahrhundert verwendete Hals- und Leibgurt beeintr&#228;chtigte die Atmung des Zugtieres und das danach gebr&#228;uchliche Stranggeschirr war nicht viel effektiver. Eine wesentliche Verbesserung war die eiserne Pflugschar. Die Wirkungsweise des Pfluges verbesserte sich durch die Anbringung eines Streichbrettes und des Messerseches enorm: Durch die Schneidwerkzeuge Schar und Sech wird der Erdstreifen herausgeschnitten und vom Streichblech gewendet. Der Bewuchs, auch ungewolltes Beikraut (sog. Unkraut), wird dadurch vergraben und es findet sich nur saubere Erde auf der Oberfl&#228;che. Bei manchen Konstruktionen findet man sogenannte Vorschneider oder Kolter. Eiserne Pflugschare (chin.: guan) mit scharfer Spitze, anschlie&#223;endem Mittelsteg und zwecks Reibungsverminderung leicht aufw&#228;rts geneigten Seitenfl&#252;geln zum Abstreichen der Erde gab es in China bereits seit dem 3. Jahrhundert v. Chr. Schon zu dieser Zeit-vor der Zeitenwende-existierten in China vier Arten von Streichbrettern, die passgenau (d. h. ohne Reibung) in die Pflugschar &#252;bergingen und den Boden unterschiedlich wendeten und aufwarfen. Weiterhin konnte man an der Konstruktion die Tiefe einstellen, in der man die Erde pfl&#252;gen wollte. Das Wissen um die Bauweise wurde im alten China von offizieller Seite verbreitet.</German>
		<Italian>The plough (American spelling: plow) is a tool used in farming for initial cultivation of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, and represents one of the major advances in agriculture. The primary purpose of ploughing is to turn over the upper layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while burying weeds and the remains of previous crops, allowing them to break down. It also aerates the soil, and allows it to hold moisture better. Ploughs were initially pulled by oxen, and later in many areas by horses (generally draught horses) and mules. In industrialised countries, the first mechanical means of pulling a plough used steam-powered (ploughing engines or steam tractors), but these were gradually superseded by internal-combustion-powered tractors.</Italian>
		<Spanish>El arado, es una herramienta de hierro utilizada en la agricultura para preparar y remover el suelo antes de sembrar las semillas. Se puede considerar como la evoluci&#243;n del pico y de la azada. En un principio el arado era tirado por personas, luego por bueyes o mulas, y en algunas zonas por caballos, actualmente tambi&#233;n los tractores tiran de ellos. Arar aumenta la porosidad, que favorece el crecimiento de las plantas, aunque al remover el suelo se pierde agua por evaporaci&#243;n y algo de suelo por erosi&#243;n, y las eventuales lluvias lavan los nutrientes y abonos que puedan haberse aplicado al suelo, generando p&#233;rdidas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El arado surgi&#243; posiblemente en Mesopotamia. El arado tradicional tirado por animales procede del arado romano, que consta de una esteva (para guiar) y reja (de hierro) que es la que rompe el terreno.</Spanish>

		<English>The oldest known canals were irrigation canals, built in Mesopotamia circa 4000 BC, in what is now modern day Iraq and Syria. The Indus Valley Civilization, in Pakistan and North India, (circa 2600 BC) had sophisticated irrigation and storage systems developed, including the reservoirs built at Girnar in 3000 BC. In Egypt, canals date back at least to the time of Pepi I Meryre (reigned 23322283 BC), who ordered a canal built to bypass the cataract on the Nile near Aswan. Irrigation may be defined as the science of artificial application of water to the land or soil. It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growing in grain fields and helping in preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dryland farming. Irrigation systems are also used for dust suppression, disposal of sewage, and in mining. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given area.</English>

Von den Erbauern und Organisatoren der gro&#223;en Wasserbauten und Kan&#228;le der alten &#196;gypter, Babylonier, Sumerer usw. ist wenig bekannt.

Obwohl im steinarmen Nildelta und in der mesopotanischen Tiefebene haupts&#228;chlich Erde als Baumaterial benutzt wurde, sind vor allem in Babylonien zahlreiche Bew&#228;sserungskan&#228;le erhalten geblieben. In den K&#252;stenregionen des nord&#246;stlichen Mittelmeers bot der trockene felsige Boden dauerhaftes Material und erm&#246;glichte sogleich einen weiteren Kreis von Aufgaben. So wurden in Israel zahlreiche St&#228;dte und Burgen mit unterirdischen Wasserkan&#228;len versorgt. Der wohl bekannteste ist der in der Bibel erw&#228;hnte Stollenbau von Jerusalem. S&#252;dlich von Jerusalem haben die Nabat&#228;er, etwa ab den 4 Jh.v.Chr. die Negev-W&#252;ste vor&#252;bergehend bewohnbar gemacht. Noch &#228;ltere Bew&#228;sserungsanlagen bzw. Dammbauten sind in Griechenland aus der Zeit der Minoer, Mykener und Minyer (16- 12 Jh.v.Chr.) erhalten. Bei den minoischen Pal&#228;sten von Knossos auf Kreta fand man unterirdisch verlegte Leitungen und Kan&#228;le wie sie sp&#228;ter f&#252;r die griech. Wasserversorgungsanlagen typisch wurden. Eine weitere erstaunliche Leistung war die r&#246;mische Bauingenieurskunst die im 3 Jh.v.Chr bis ins 1 Jh.n.Chr.

		<English>The history of glassmaking can be traced back to 3500 BCE in Mesopotamia. Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or Old Kingdom Egypt. Because of Egypts favorable environment for preservation, the majority of well-studied early glass is found there, although some of this is likely to have been imported. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid third millennium BCE, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing. During the Late Bronze Age in Egypt (e.g., the Ahhotep "Treasure") and Western Asia (e.g. Megiddo) there was a rapid growth in glass-making technology. Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass ingots, vessels (often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized hardstone carvings in semi-precious stones) and the ubiquitous beads. The alkali of Syrian and Egyptian glass was soda ash, sodium carbonate, which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants, notably halophile seashore plants. The earliest vessels were core-wound, produced by winding a ductile rope of glass round a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod, then fusing it with repeated reheatings. Threads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of oxides were subsequently wound around these to create patterns, which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools. The vessel would then be rolled flat (marvered) on a slab in order to press the decorative threads into its body. Handles and feet were applied separately. The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly annealed and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel, after which the core material was scraped out. Glass shapes for inlays were also often created in moulds. Much early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state. According to Pliny the Elder, Phoenician traders were the first to stumble upon glass manufacturing techniques at the site of the Belus River.</English>

		<German>Ob die Glasherstellung in Mesopotamien, in &#196;gypten oder an der Levantek&#252;ste erfunden wurde, l&#228;sst sich nicht mit letzter Gewissheit sagen. Die &#228;ltesten bekannten Glasobjekte sind Perlen und Amulette. Glasgef&#228;&#223;e sind nicht vor 1500 v. Chr. nachgewiesen. Handwerker aus Asien haben wahrscheinlich die Glasherstellung nach &#196;gypten gebracht, wo die ersten Gef&#228;&#223;e aus der Zeit von Thutmosis III. (1504-1450 v. Chr.) datieren. Die Glaserzeugung erlebte in &#196;gypten und Mesopotamien bis etwa 1200 v. Chr. eine erste Bl&#252;te. Da die &#196;gypter die Technik des Glasblasens noch nicht kannten, konnten sie lediglich kleine Gef&#228;&#223;e herstellen, die zur Aufbewahrung von Salben und Essenzen dienten. Glasgegenst&#228;nde galten als ausgesprochene Luxusartikel, da sie in einem schwierigen Verfahren gefertigt werden mussten. Der Herstellungsort dieses fr&#252;hesten Glases ist allerdings unbekannt, er wird in Theben, dem heutigen Luxor vermutet. Die bekannteste Verarbeitungstechnik beruht auf dem Herstellen von Hohlgef&#228;&#223;en durch das Wickeln von erweichten Glasst&#228;bchen um einen por&#246;sen Keramikkern, der anschlie&#223;end herausgekratzt wurde.

		<English>An alphabet is a standardized set of letters-basic written symbols or graphemes-each of which roughly represents a phoneme in a spoken language, either as it exists now or as it was in the past. There are other systems, such as logographies, in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit, and syllabaries, in which each character represents a syllable. The word "alphabet" came into Middle English from the Late Latin word Alphabetum, which in turn originated in the Ancient Greek Alphabetos, from alpha and beta, the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha and beta in turn came from the first two letters of the Phoenician alphabet, and meant ox and house respectively and the first three letters of the Arabic language "Alef, ?", "Ba, ?", and "Ta, ?". There are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most common being Latin, deriving from the first true alphabet, Greek. The history of the alphabet is believed to have begun in Ancient Egypt, more than a millennium into the history of writing. The first consonantal alphabet found has emerged around 2000 BCE to represent the language of Semitic workers in Egypt, and was at least influenced by the alphabetic principles of the Egyptian hieratic script. Nearly all alphabets in the world today either descend directly from this development or were inspired by its design. Two scripts are well attested from before the end of the fourth millennium BCE: Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Both were well known in the part of the Middle East that produced the first widely used alphabet, the Phoenician. There are signs that cuneiform was developing alphabetic properties in some of the languages it was adapted for, as was seen again later in the Old Persian cuneiform script, but it now appears these developments were a sideline and not ancestral to the alphabet. The Byblos syllabary has suggestive graphic similarities to both hieratic Egyptian and to the Phoenician alphabet, but as it is undeciphered, little can be said about its role, if any, in the history of the alphabet. By 2700 BCE the ancient Egyptians had developed a set of some 22 hieroglyphs to represent the individual consonants of their language, plus a 23rd that seems to have represented word-initial or word-final vowels. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names. However, although alphabetic in nature, the system was not used for purely alphabetic writing except when transcribing foreign names. That is, while capable of being used as an alphabet, it was in fact nearly always used with a strong logographic component, presumably due to strong cultural attachment to the complex Egyptian script. A Semitic language is attested in Egyptian hieroglyphs from 2400 BCE, but glyphs have their Egyptian values and so were not ancestral to the alphabet. The first purely alphabetic script is thought to have been developed around 1850 BCE for Semitic workers in the Sinai but giving mostly Egyptian glyphs Semitic values. Over the next five centuries it spread north, and all subsequent alphabets around the world have either descended from it, or been inspired by one of its descendants, with the possible exception of the Meroitic alphabet, a 3rd century BCE adaptation of hieroglyphs in Nubia to the south of Egypt-though even here many scholars suspect the influence of that first alphabet.</English>

		<German>Seit antiker Zeit sind drei verschiedene Darstellungsarten zu unterscheiden. Die &#228;lteste, das akrophone Prinzip, setzte bei den Anfangsbuchstaben der Zahlw&#246;rter an, w&#228;hrend die beiden anderen jeweils von der Reihenfolge der Buchstaben im Alphabet ausgingen, denen dann entweder nach dem milesischen Prinzip dekadisch gestufte Zahlwerte oder aber nach dem Thesis-Prinzip unmittelbar aus deren Stellung im Alphabet abgeleitete Zahlwerte zugeordnet wurden. Letzteres fand aber, da es auf nur 24 Werte beschr&#228;nkt ist, bei den Mathematikern keine Verwendung. Das alphabetische Zahlensystem ist eine Idee der Griechen. Andere Alphabete wurden erst sp&#228;ter nach ihrem Modell adaptiert. Das Prinzip des Systems selbst ist jedoch schon in der hieratischen und der demotischen Schreibweise der &#228;gyptischen Zahlen gebr&#228;uchlich. Das alphabetische Zahlensystem war im alten Griechenland das bei weitem bedeutendste.

Two scripts are well attested from before the end of the fourth millennium BCE: Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Both were well known in the part of the Middle East that produced the first widely used alphabet, the Phoenician. There are signs that cuneiform was developing alphabetic properties in some of the languages it was adapted for, as was seen again later in the Old Persian cuneiform script, but it now appears these developments were a sideline and not ancestral to the alphabet. The Byblos syllabary has suggestive graphic similarities to both hieratic Egyptian and to the Phoenician alphabet, but as it is undeciphered, little can be said about its role, if any, in the history of the alphabet. By 2700 BCE the ancient Egyptians had developed a set of some 22 hieroglyphs to represent the individual consonants of their language, plus a 23rd that seems to have represented word-initial or word-final vowels. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names. However, although alphabetic in nature, the system was not used for purely alphabetic writing except when transcribing foreign names. That is, while capable of being used as an alphabet, it was in fact nearly always used with a strong logographic component, presumably due to strong cultural attachment to the complex Egyptian script. A Semitic language is attested in Egyptian hieroglyphs from 2400 BCE, but glyphs have their Egyptian values and so were not ancestral to the alphabet. The first purely alphabetic script is thought to have been developed around 1850 BCE for Semitic workers in the Sinai but giving mostly Egyptian glyphs Semitic values. Over the next five centuries it spread north, and all subsequent alphabets around the world have either descended from it, or been inspired by one of its descendants, with the possible exception of the Meroitic alphabet, a 3rd century BCE adaptation of hieroglyphs in Nubia to the south of Egypt-though even here many scholars suspect the influence of that first alphabet.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Los numerales griegos son un sistema de numeraci&#243;n que usa letras del alfabeto griego. En la Grecia moderna a&#250;n se usa frecuentemente el sistema j&#243;nico para los n&#250;meros ordinales y m&#225;s raramente para los cardinales, de forma parecida al uso de los n&#250;meros romanos en el occidente europeo; para el resto de usos se emplea la numeraci&#243;n ar&#225;biga.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El sistema de numeraci&#243;n griego m&#225;s antiguo fue el &#225;tico o acrof&#243;nico, que funcionaba de forma parecida al romano, que deriva de este sistema a trav&#233;s del etrusco.[NEWLINE]Se denomina acrof&#243;nico porque, con excepci&#243;n del s&#237;mbolo para 1 (un mero trazo vertical), los dem&#225;s proced&#237;an de la primera letra de cada n&#250;mero en escritura arcaica: p&#233;nte (cinco), d&#233;ka (diez), hekat&#243;n (cien), ch&#237;lioi (mil), myr&#237;as (diez mil).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A partir del siglo IV a. C., el sistema acrof&#243;nico fue siendo sustituido por un sistema alfab&#233;tico cuasidecimal, a veces llamado j&#243;nico. A cada cifra de unidad (1-9) se le asigna una letra, a cada decena (10-90) otra letra y a cada centena (100-900) otra letra. Esto requiere 27 letras, as&#237; que se a&#241;adieron al sistema griego de 24 letras otras tres letras ya anticuadas:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  digamma o stigma para el 6 (en griego moderno se emplea frecuentemente la combinaci&#243;n sigma-tau),[NEWLINE]  qoppa para el 90 (en griego moderno se utiliza el qoppa num&#233;rico, y existe la forma uncial),[NEWLINE]  sampi para el 900.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se coloca un acento agudo al final del grupo para distinguir n&#250;meros de letras. El sistema alfab&#233;tico o jonio se basa en el principio de la suma en el que los valores num&#233;ricos de las letras se suman para formar el total. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Para representar n&#250;meros del 1 000 al 999 999 se vuelven a usar las mismas letras de las unidades, decenas y centenas, a&#241;adiendo un acento agudo invertido o una coma para distinguirlos. No se utiliza ning&#250;n s&#237;mbolo para representar el 0.[NEWLINE]</Spanish>

		<English>Astronomy is the oldest of the natural sciences, dating back to antiquity, with its origins in the religious, mythological, and astrological practices of pre-history: vestiges of these are still found in astrology, a discipline long interwoven with public and governmental astronomy, and not completely disentangled from it until a few centuries ago in the Western World. In some cultures astronomical data was used for astrological prognostication. Ancient astronomers were able to differentiate between stars and planets, as stars remain relatively fixed over the centuries while planets will move an appreciable amount during a comparatively short time. Early cultures identified celestial objects with gods and spirits. They related these objects (and their movements) to phenomena such as rain, drought, seasons, and tides. It is generally believed that the first "professional" astronomers were priests and that their understanding of the "heavens" was seen as "divine", hence astronomys ancient connection to what is now called astrology. Ancient structures with possibly astronomical alignments (such as Stonehenge) probably fulfilled both astronomical and religious functions. According to Asger Aaboe, the origins of Western astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia, and all Western efforts in the exact sciences are descendants in direct line from the work of the late Babylonian astronomers. Our knowledge of Sumerian astronomy is indirect, via the earliest Babylonian star catalogues dating from about 1200 BCE. The fact that many star names appear in Sumerian suggests a continuity reaching into the Early Bronze Age. The history of astronomy in Mesopotamia, and the world, begins with the Sumerians who developed the earliest writing systemknown as cuneiformaround 35003200 BC. The Sumerians developed a form of astronomy that had an important influence on the sophisticated astronomy of the Babylonians. Astrolatry, which gave planetary gods an important role in Mesopotamian mythology and religion, began with the Sumerians. They also used a sexagesimal (base 60) place-value number system, which simplified the task of recording very great and very small numbers. The modern practice of dividing a circle into 360 degrees, of 60 minutes each, began with the Sumerians.</English>

		<German>Die Astronomie gilt als die &#228;lteste Wissenschaft der Menschheit. Seit dem 8. Jhd. v. Chr. wurden in Babylon systematische Beobachtungen von Sternen und Planeten durchgef&#252;hrt. Arithmetische Methoden der Interpolation erm&#246;glichten den Babyloniern sogar die Vorhersage von Finsternissen. F&#252;r &#196;gypten existieren bis in das 3. Jahrtausend v.

Die &#196;gypter nutzten f&#252;r die Nacht zw&#246;lf Sterne zur Zeitmessung, wobei die L&#228;nge des jeweils ersten und letzten Zeitabschnitts je nach Jahreszeit angepasst wurde. Babylonier und Assyrer bewahrten in ihren Archiven Aufzeichnungen &#252;ber ihre astronomischen Beobachtungen, die selbst nach vorsichtigen Sch&#228;tzungen bis ins dritte vorchristliche Jahrtausend zur&#252;ckreichen.

		<Spanish>La astronom&#237;a es la ciencia que se compone del estudio de los cuerpos celestes del Universo, incluidos los planetas y sus sat&#233;lites, los cometas y meteoroides, las estrellas y la materia interestelar, los sistemas de estrellas, gas y polvo llamados galaxias y los c&#250;mulos de galaxias; por lo que estudia sus movimientos y los fen&#243;menos ligados a ellos. Su registro y la investigaci&#243;n de su origen viene a partir de la informaci&#243;n que llega de ellos a trav&#233;s de la radiaci&#243;n electromagn&#233;tica o de cualquier otro medio. La astronom&#237;a ha estado ligada al ser humano desde la antig&#252;edad y todas las civilizaciones han tenido contacto con esta ciencia. Personajes como Arist&#243;teles, Tales de Mileto, Anax&#225;goras, Aristarco de Samos, Hiparco de Nicea, Claudio Ptolomeo, Hipatia de Alejandr&#237;a, Nicol&#225;s Cop&#233;rnico, Santo Tom&#225;s de Aquino, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, han sido algunos de sus cultivadores.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Es una de las pocas ciencias en las que los aficionados a&#250;n pueden desempe&#241;ar un papel activo, especialmente en el descubrimiento y seguimiento de fen&#243;menos como curvas de luz de estrellas variables, descubrimiento de asteroides y cometas, etc.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Etimol&#243;gicamente, la palabra "astronom&#237;a" proviene del lat&#237;n astronomia, que a su vez deriva del griego 'astron' estrella y seguido de 'nomos' regla, norma. La mayor parte de las ciencias utilizan el sufijo griego 'log&#237;a' tratado, estudio, como por ejemplo cosmolog&#237;a y biolog&#237;a. De hecho, "astronom&#237;a" deb&#237;a propiamente haberse llamado "astrolog&#237;a", pero esta denominaci&#243;n ha sido usurpada por la pseudociencia que hoy en d&#237;a es conocida con dicho nombre. Por ello no debe confundirse la astronom&#237;a con la astrolog&#237;a. Aunque ambas comparten un origen com&#250;n, son muy diferentes. Mientras que la astronom&#237;a es una ciencia estudiada a trav&#233;s del m&#233;todo cient&#237;fico, la astrolog&#237;a es una pseudociencia que sigue un sistema de creencias no probadas o abiertamente err&#243;neas. En general se encarga de estudiar la supuesta influencia de los astros sobre la vida de los hombres.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Uno de los primeros en realizar un trabajo astron&#243;mico-cient&#237;fico fue Aristarco de Samos (310 &#8211; 230 a. C.) quien calcul&#243; las distancias que separan a la Tierra de la Luna y del Sol, y adem&#225;s propuso un modelo helioc&#233;ntrico del Sistema Solar en el que, como su nombre lo indica, el Sol es el centro del universo, y alrededor del cual giran todos los otros astros, incluyendo la Tierra. Este modelo, imperfecto en su momento, pero que hoy sabemos se acerca mucho a lo que hoy consideramos como correcto, no fue acogido debido a que chocaba con las observaciones cotidianas y la percepci&#243;n de la Tierra como centro de la creaci&#243;n. Este modelo helioc&#233;ntrico est&#225; descripto en la obra el Arenario de Arqu&#237;medes (287 &#8211; 212 a. C.).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El modelo geoc&#233;ntrico fue una idea original de Eudoxo de Cnido (390 &#8211; 337 a. C.) y a&#241;os despu&#233;s recibi&#243; el apoyo decidido de Arist&#243;teles y su escuela. Este modelo, sin embargo, no explicaba algunos fen&#243;menos observados, el m&#225;s importante de ellos era el comportamiento diferente del movimiento de algunos astros cuando se comparaba &#233;ste con el observado para la mayor&#237;a de las estrellas. Estas parecen siempre moverse todas en conjunto, con la misma rapidez angular, lo que hace que, al moverse, mantengan 'fijas' sus posiciones unas respecto de las otras. Por esta raz&#243;n se les conoci&#243; siempre como estrellas fijas. Sin embargo, ciertos astros visibles en el firmamento nocturno, si bien se mov&#237;an en conjunto con las estrellas, parec&#237;an hacerlo con menor velocidad (movimiento directo). De hecho, se observan retrasarse todos los d&#237;as un poco respecto de ellas; pero, adem&#225;s, y s&#243;lo en ciertas ocasiones, parecen detener el retraso e invertir su movimiento respecto de las estrellas 'fijas' (movimiento retr&#243;grado), para luego detenerse nuevamente, y volver a retomar el sentido del movimiento de ellas, pero siempre con un peque&#241;o retraso diario (movimiento directo). Debido a estos cambios aparentemente irregulares en su movimiento a trav&#233;s de las estrellas 'fijas,' a estos astros se les denomin&#243; estrellas 'errantes' o estrellas 'planetas,' para diferenciarlas de las otras.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fue Ptolomeo quien se dio a la tarea de buscar una soluci&#243;n para que el sistema geoc&#233;ntrico pudiera ser compatible con todas estas observaciones.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el sistema ptolemaico la tierra es el centro del universo y la luna, el sol, los planetas y las estrellas fijas se encuentran en esferas de cristal girando alrededor de ella; para explicar el movimiento diferente de los planetas ide&#243; un particular sistema en el cual la Tierra no estaba en el centro exacto y los planetas giraban en un epiciclo alrededor de un punto ubicado en la circunferencia de su &#243;rbita o esfera principal (conocida como 'Deferente').[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los epiciclos hab&#237;an sido una idea original de Apolonio de P&#233;rgamo (262 &#8211; 190 a. C.) y mejorada por Hiparco de Nicea (190 &#8211; 120 a. C.). Como el planeta gira alrededor de su epiciclo mientras el centro de &#233;ste se mueve simult&#225;neamente sobre la esfera de su deferente, se logra, por la combinaci&#243;n de ambos movimientos, que el planeta se mueva en el sentido de las estrellas 'fijas' (aunque con cierto peque&#241;o retraso diario) y que, en ocasiones, revierta este movimiento (de retraso) y parezca (por cierto per&#237;odo de tiempo) adelantarse a las estrellas fijas, y con esto se logra explicar el movimiento retr&#243;grado de los planetas, respecto de las estrellas (ver figura a la derecha). El esquema ptolemaico, con todo y sus complicados epiciclos y deferentes, fue aceptado por muchos siglos por variadas razones pero, principalmente, por darle a la raza humana una supremac&#237;a y un lugar privilegiado o 'central' en el universo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Otros estudios importantes durante esta &#233;poca fueron: la determinaci&#243;n del tama&#241;o de la Tierra;la composicion de la tierra, la compilaci&#243;n del primer cat&#225;logo estelar; el desarrollo de un sistema de clasificaci&#243;n de las magnitudes de los brillos estelares basado en la luminosidad aparente de las diferentes estrellas; la determinaci&#243;n del ciclo de Saros para la predicci&#243;n de los eclipses solares y lunares, entre muchos otros.</Spanish>

		<English>Geometry (Ancient Greek; geo- "earth", -metri "measurement") "Earth-measuring" is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. Geometry is one of the oldest mathematical sciences. Initially a body of practical knowledge concerning lengths, areas, and volumes, in the 3rd century BC geometry was put into an axiomatic form by Euclid, whose treatmentEuclidean geometryset a standard for many centuries to follow. Archimedes developed ingenious techniques for calculating areas and volumes, in many ways anticipating modern integral calculus. The field of astronomy, especially mapping the positions of the stars and planets on the celestial sphere and describing the relationship between movements of celestial bodies, served as an important source of geometric problems during the next one and a half millennia. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer. The earliest recorded beginnings of geometry can be traced to ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley from around 3000 BCE. Early geometry was a collection of empirically discovered principles concerning lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical need in surveying, construction, astronomy, and various crafts. The earliest known texts on geometry are the Egyptian Rhind Papyrus and Moscow Papyrus, the Babylonian clay tablets, and the Indian Shulba Sutras, while the Chinese had the work of Mozi, Zhang Heng, and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, edited by Liu Hui.

		<German>Geometrie (zu deutsch "Vermessung der Erde") ist sicher eine der &#228;ltesten Wissenschaften. &#220;berall dort, wo Ausgrabungen Geschichten pr&#228;historischer Kulturen in unsere Zeit sprechen lassen, erz&#228;hlen sie auch eine Geschichte der Geometrie: regelm&#228;&#223;ig oder symmetrisch geformte, bemalte oder angeordnete Alltags-, Gebrauchs-, oder Ritualgegenst&#228;nde, zeugen von dem Erkennen und &#220;bertragen geometrischer Strukturen, die sich vielf&#228;ltig in der Natur finden lassen. Kugel&#228;hnliche Tongef&#228;&#223;e lassen sich bei gleichem Fassungsverm&#246;gen materialsparender und stabiler herstellen wie quaderf&#246;rmige, die sich daf&#252;r besser schlichten lassen. Anhand von Gestirnen kann man sich orientieren und bei Malereien in H&#246;hlen und auf Ton erkennt man Menschen, Tiere und Landschaften wieder, wenn man sie so verkleinert darstellt, dass die Proportionen erhalten bleiben. Auch die mit den ersten Hochkulturen entstehenden Schriftsprachen &#252;berliefern geometrisches Wissen aus Baukunst, Handwerk, Landwirtschaft und Astronomie. So konnte man in &#196;gypten nicht nur geradlinig begrenzte Fl&#228;chen in rechtwinklige Dreiecke und diese wiederum in Rechtecke fl&#228;chengleich umwandeln, auch die Formel f&#252;r das Volumen allgemeiner Pyramidenst&#252;mpfe war bekannt. Die Umsetzung dieser Kenntnisse in Bauwerken wie den Pyramiden von Gizeh (ca. 2900 v. Chr.) beeindrucken noch heute. Die Griechen begannen die geometrische Aussagen zu hinterfragen. In Streitgespr&#228;chen wurden immer sch&#228;rfere Ma&#223;st&#228;be angelegt, immer mehr wurde hinterfragt und man begann Argumente auf logische Fehler zu untersuchen. Diese konstruktive Skepsis machte auch vor der Geometrie nicht halt und f&#252;hrte in ihrer Pr&#228;zisierung zum einen zu den ber&#252;hmten Beweisen von Pythagoras und seinen Sch&#252;lern und zum anderen zu der Formulierung der Euklidschen Geometrie.</German>

		<Spanish>La geometr&#237;a (del lat&#237;n geometria, que proviene del idioma griego geo tierra y metria medida), es una rama de la matem&#225;tica que se ocupa del estudio de las propiedades de las figuras geom&#233;tricas en el plano o el espacio, como son: puntos, rectas, planos, politopos (incluyendo paralelas, perpendiculares, curvas, superficies, pol&#237;gonos, poliedros, etc.).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Es la base te&#243;rica de la geometr&#237;a descriptiva o del dibujo t&#233;cnico. Tambi&#233;n da fundamento a instrumentos como el comp&#225;s, el teodolito, el pant&#243;grafo o el sistema de posicionamiento global (en especial cuando se la considera en combinaci&#243;n con el an&#225;lisis matem&#225;tico y sobre todo con las ecuaciones diferenciales).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Es razonable pensar que el origen de la geometr&#237;a surge con los primeros pictogramas que traza el hombre primitivo pues, seguramente, clasificaba aun de manera inconsciente lo que le rodeaba seg&#250;n su forma. En la abstracci&#243;n de estas formas comienza el primer acercamiento informal e intuitivo a la geometr&#237;a. As&#237; parece confirmarlo la ornamentaci&#243;n esquem&#225;tica abstracta en vasijas de cer&#225;mica y otros utensilios.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las primeras civilizaciones mediterr&#225;neas adquieren poco a poco ciertos conocimientos geom&#233;tricos de car&#225;cter eminentemente pr&#225;ctico. La geometr&#237;a en el antiguo Egipto estaba muy desarrollada, como admitieron Her&#243;doto, Estrab&#243;n y Diodoro, que aceptaban que los egipcios hab&#237;an "inventado" la geometr&#237;a y la hab&#237;an ense&#241;ado a los griegos; aunque lo &#250;nico que ha perdurado son algunas f&#243;rmulas &#8211; o, mejor dicho, algoritmos expresados en forma de "receta" &#8211; para calcular vol&#250;menes, &#225;reas y longitudes, cuya finalidad era pr&#225;ctica. Con ellas se pretend&#237;a, por ejemplo, calcular la dimensi&#243;n de las parcelas de tierra, para reconstruirlas despu&#233;s de las inundaciones anuales. De all&#237; el nombre geometr&#237;a: "medici&#243;n de la tierra" (de g&#234; 'tierra' m&#225;s metr&#237;a, 'medici&#243;n').[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los denominados Papiro de Ahmes y Papiro de Mosc&#250; muestran conjuntos de m&#233;todos pr&#225;cticos para obtener diversas &#225;reas y vol&#250;menes, destinados al aprendizaje de escribas. Es discutible si estos documentos implican profundos conocimientos o representan en cambio todo el conocimiento que los antiguos egipcios ten&#237;an sobre la geometr&#237;a.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La Geometr&#237;a Griega fue la primera en ser formal. Parte de los conocimientos concretos y pr&#225;cticos de las civilizaciones egipcia y mesopot&#225;mica, y da un paso de abstracci&#243;n al considerar los objetos como entes ideales &#8211; un rect&#225;ngulo ideal, en lugar de una pared cuadrada concreta, un c&#237;rculo en lugar del ojo de un pozo, etc. &#8211; que pueden ser manipulados mentalmente, con la sola ayuda de regla y comp&#225;s. Aparece por primera vez la demostraci&#243;n como justificaci&#243;n de la veracidad de un conocimiento aunque, en un primer momento, fueran m&#225;s justificaciones intuitivas que verdaderas demostraciones formales.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tales permaneci&#243; en Egipto una larga temporada de su vida, aprendiendo de los conocimientos de sacerdotes y escribas. Fue el primero en ser capaz de calcular la altura de las Pir&#225;mides de Egipto. Para ello midi&#243; su propia altura, y en el preciso momento en el que su sombra med&#237;a exactamente la misma cantidad, mand&#243; a marcar la sombra del v&#233;rtice de la Gran Pir&#225;mide. De esa forma pudo calcular exactamente cu&#225;l era su altura.1 Tambi&#233;n se le atribuye la predicci&#243;n de un eclipse solar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La figura de Pit&#225;goras y de la secta por &#233;l creada: los pitag&#243;ricos, tiene un papel central, pues eleva a la categor&#237;a de elemento primigenio el concepto de n&#250;mero (filosof&#237;a que de forma m&#225;s expl&#237;cita o m&#225;s impl&#237;cita, siempre ha estado dentro de la Matem&#225;tica y de la F&#237;sica), arrastrando a la Geometr&#237;a al centro de su doctrina &#8211; en este momento inicial de la historia de la Matem&#225;tica a&#250;n no hay una distinci&#243;n clara entre Geometr&#237;a y Aritm&#233;tica &#8211; , y asienta definitivamente el concepto de demostraci&#243;n (&#233;ste ya s&#237; coincide con el concepto de demostraci&#243;n formal) como &#250;nica v&#237;a de establecimiento de la verdad en Geometr&#237;a.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Esta actitud permiti&#243; (aun fuera de la secta) la medici&#243;n del radio de la Tierra por Erat&#243;stenes, as&#237; como la medici&#243;n de la distancia a la Luna, y la investigaci&#243;n y establecimiento de la teor&#237;a de las palancas, por Arqu&#237;medes, varios siglos despu&#233;s.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el seno de la secta de los pitag&#243;ricos surge la primera crisis de la Matem&#225;tica: la aparici&#243;n de los inconmensurables, pero esta crisis es de car&#225;cter m&#225;s aritm&#233;tico que geom&#233;trico.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Surge entonces un peque&#241;o problema de L&#243;gica, que consiste en lo siguiente: una demostraci&#243;n parte de una o varias hip&#243;tesis para obtener un resultado denominado tesis. La veracidad de la tesis depender&#225; de la validez del razonamiento con el que se ha extra&#237;do (esto ser&#225; estudiado por Arist&#243;teles al crear la L&#243;gica) y de la veracidad de las hip&#243;tesis. Pero entonces debemos partir de hip&#243;tesis ciertas para poder afirmar con rotundidad la tesis. Para poder determinar la veracidad de las hip&#243;tesis, habr&#225; que considerar cada una como tesis de otro razonamiento, cuyas hip&#243;tesis deberemos tambi&#233;n comprobar. Se entra aparentemente en un proceso sin fin en el que, indefinidamente, las hip&#243;tesis se convierten en tesis a probar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Euclides, vinculado al Museo de Alejandr&#237;a y a su Biblioteca, zanja la cuesti&#243;n al proponer un sistema de estudio en el que se da por sentado la veracidad de ciertas proposiciones por ser intuitivamente claras, y deducir de ellas todos los dem&#225;s resultados. Su sistema se sintetiza en su obra cumbre, Los elementos, modelo de sistema axiom&#225;tico-deductivo. Sobre tan s&#243;lo cinco postulados y las definiciones que precisa construye toda la Geometr&#237;a y la Aritm&#233;tica conocidas hasta el momento.

No se pon&#237;a en duda su veracidad, pero tal y como aparece expresado en la obra, muchos consideran que seguramente pod&#237;a deducirse del resto de postulados. Durante los siguientes siglos, uno de los principales problemas de la Geometr&#237;a ser&#225; determinar si el V postulado es o no independiente de los otros cuatro, es decir, si es necesario considerarlo como un postulado o es un teorema, es decir, puede deducirse de los otros, y por lo tanto colocarse entre el resto de resultados de la obra.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los historiadores antiguos nos relataron que el conocimiento de esta civilizaci&#243;n sobre geometr&#237;a &#8211; as&#237; como los de las culturas mesopot&#225;micas &#8211; pas&#243; &#237;ntegramente a la cultura griega a trav&#233;s de Tales de Mileto, los pitag&#243;ricos y, esencialmente, de Euclides.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sus or&#237;genes se remontan a la soluci&#243;n de problemas concretos relativos a medidas.

		<English>Music is an art form whose medium is sound. Common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. The word derives from Greek (mousike), "(art) of the Muses." The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their recreation in performance), through improvisational music to aleatoric forms. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within "the arts," music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art, and auditory art. There is also a strong connection between music and mathematics. Music is found in every known culture, past and present, varying wildly between times and places. Around 50,000 years ago, early modern humans began to disperse from Africa, reaching all the habitable continents. Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, scientists conclude that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans around the world. Consequently music may have been in existence for at least 50,000 years and the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a fundamental constituent of human life. A cultures music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology. The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and composers all vary between regions and periods. "Music history" is the distinct subfield of musicology and history which studies music (particularly Western art music) from a chronological perspective. Prehistoric music, once more commonly called primitive music, is the name given to all music produced in preliterate cultures (prehistory), beginning somewhere in very late geological history. Prehistoric music is followed by ancient music in most of Europe (1500 BCE) and later musics in subsequent European-influenced areas, but still exists in isolated areas. Prehistoric music thus technically includes all of the worlds music that has existed before the advent of any currently extant historical sources concerning that music, for example, traditional Native American music of preliterate tribes and Australian Aboriginal music. However, it is more common to refer to the "prehistoric" music of non-European continents especially that which still survives as folk, indigenous or traditional music. The origin of music is unknown as it occurred prior to the advent of recorded history. Some suggest that the origin of music likely stems from naturally occurring sounds and rhythms. Human music may echo these phenomena using patterns, repetition and tonality. Even today, some cultures have certain instances of their music intending to imitate natural sounds. In some instances, this feature is related to shamanistic beliefs or practice. It may also serve entertainment (game) or practical (luring animals in hunt) functions. It is probable that the first musical instrument was the human voice itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from singing, humming and whistling through to clicking, coughing and yawning. In 2008 archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the Hohle Fels cave near Ulm, Germany. The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone. The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near Greystones, Ireland, in 2004. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50 cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together. Ancient music is music that developed in literate cultures, replacing prehistoric music. Ancient music refers to the various musical systems that were developed across various geographical regions such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia, India, China, Greece and Rome. Ancient music is designated by the characterization of the basic audible tones and scales. It may have been transmitted through oral or written systems. Musical instruments, such as the seven-holed flute and various types of stringed instruments have been recovered from the Indus valley civilization archaeological sites.</English>

		<German>Der Ursprung der Musik, zu allen Zeiten und bei allen V&#246;lkern ein beliebter Gegenstand der Spekulation und der Forschung, wird bei den V&#246;lkern des Altertums mit &#220;bereinstimmung von der Gottheit hergeleitet, infolgedessen ihnen allen die Musik als bildend und veredelnd, unter Umst&#228;nden auch als Wunder wirkend gilt. Schon bei den Indern herrschte diese Anschauung, welche in Brahma nicht nur den obersten der G&#246;tter, sondern auch den Sch&#246;pfer der Musik und in seinem Sohne Nared den Erfinder des nationalen Musikinstruments, der Vina, verehren. Die Musik im &#246;ffentlichen Leben Chinas nahm eine hervorragende Stellung ein; man erkannte in ihr ein wirksames Mittel zur Bef&#246;rderung der Sittlichkeit, und der weiseste aller chinesischen Gesetzgeber, Konfutse (500 v. Chr.), behauptete sogar, wenn man wissen wolle, ob ein Land wohl regiert und gut gesittet sei, so m&#252;sse man seine Musik h&#246;ren. In &#196;gypten spielte die Musik im &#246;ffentlichen wie im Privatleben eine wichtige Rolle. Das zeigen die zahlreichen, auf fast allen Monumenten des Landes wiederkehrenden bildlichen Darstellungen von S&#228;ngern und Instrumentalisten, bald einzeln, bald zu Ch&#246;ren und Orchestern vereint. Auch l&#228;sst die Mannigfaltigkeit der dort erscheinenden Instrumente, unter ihnen die gro&#223;e, reichbesaitete Harfe, auf eine gewisse &#228;u&#223;ere Pracht und &#220;ppigkeit der &#228;gyptischen Musik schlie&#223;en. Die Geschichte der griechischen Musik ist so mit Sagen und M&#228;rchen durchsetzt, dass der historische Kern nur schwer kenntlich ist. Die Erfindung der musikalischen Instrumente wie der Musik &#252;berhaupt wird den G&#246;ttern zugeschrieben (Apollon, Hermes, Athene, Pan). Die Musizierpraxis kann im Grunde nur ikonographisch, d. h. aus Abbildungen, z. B. auf Gef&#228;&#223;en, erschlossen werden. Teils finden sich aber auch literarische Hinweise, wie z. B. in Homers Odyssee. Der kulturelle Einfluss Kleinasiens und &#196;gyptens war bedeutend. Zur praktischen Musikaus&#252;bung der Griechen z&#228;hlte blo&#223;er Gesang oder Gesang mit Begleitung von Saiteninstrumenten (Kitharodie) oder Blasinstrumenten (Aulodie), sowie rein instrumentales Saiten- (Kitharistik) oder Fl&#246;tenspiel (Auletik). Die r&#246;mische Musik stand, wie auch die Dichtung, anf&#228;nglich ganz unter Einwirkung der griechischen Poesie. Anf&#228;nglich, in schriftloser Zeit, war die rhythmische Sprache eine St&#252;tze f&#252;r das Ged&#228;chtnis. Die S&#228;nger und Musiker waren vor allem Praktiker und lehnten sich in ihrer Interpretation an die Akzente der gesprochenen Sprache an; Hilfszeichen f&#252;r das An- und Absteigen der Stimme wurden bereits von Aristophanes von Byzanz im 3. Jh. v. Chr. erfunden. Musik hatte immer neben einer rituellen und symbolischen Bedeutung eine besondere Rolle in den sozialen Strukturen der Gesellschaft. In Rom suchte man in der Musik zwar nicht den ethischen, charakterbildenden Wert wie in Griechenland, sie diente aber als unentbehrliche Begleiterin im Kult, bei Leichenfeiern, im Heer und bei Staatsaktionen wie Triumphz&#252;gen und auch bei Auff&#252;hrungen im Zirkus und Amphitheater.</German>

		<Spanish>La m&#250;sica (del griego: mousik&#275; [t&#233;chn&#275;], "el arte de las musas") es, seg&#250;n la definici&#243;n tradicional del t&#233;rmino, el arte de organizar sensible y l&#243;gicamente una combinaci&#243;n coherente de sonidos y silencios utilizando los principios fundamentales de la melod&#237;a, la armon&#237;a y el ritmo, mediante la intervenci&#243;n de complejos procesos psico-an&#237;micos. El concepto de m&#250;sica ha ido evolucionando desde su origen en la antigua Grecia, en que se reun&#237;a sin distinci&#243;n a la poes&#237;a, la m&#250;sica y la danza como arte unitario. Desde hace varias d&#233;cadas se ha vuelto m&#225;s compleja la definici&#243;n de qu&#233; es y qu&#233; no es la m&#250;sica, ya que destacados compositores, en el marco de diversas experiencias art&#237;sticas fronterizas, han realizado obras que, si bien podr&#237;an considerarse musicales, expanden los l&#237;mites de la definici&#243;n de este arte.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hay constancia de que hacia el 3000 a. C. en Sumeria ya contaban con instrumentos de percusi&#243;n y cuerda (lira y arpa). Los cantos cultos antiguos eran m&#225;s bien lamentaciones sobre textos po&#233;ticos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la prehistoria aparece la m&#250;sica en los rituales de caza o de guerra y en las fiestas donde, alrededor del fuego, se danzaba hasta el agotamiento. La m&#250;sica est&#225; basada principalmente en ritmos y movimientos que imitan a los animales. Las manifestaciones musicales del hombre consisten en la exteriorizaci&#243;n de sus sentimientos a trav&#233;s del sonido emanado de su propia voz y con el fin de distinguirlo del habla que utiliza para comunicarse con otros seres.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La m&#250;sica en Egipto pose&#237;a avanzados conocimientos que eran reservados para los sacerdotes, en el Imperio Nuevo utilizaban ya la escala de siete sonidos. Este pueblo cont&#243; con instrumentario rico y variado, algunos de los m&#225;s representativos son el arpa como instrumento de cuerdas y el oboe doble como instrumento de viento. En Mesopotamia los m&#250;sicos eran considerados personas de gran prestigio, acompa&#241;aban al monarca no solo en los actos de culto sino tambi&#233;n en las suntuosas ceremonias de palacio y en las guerras. El arpa es uno de los instrumentos m&#225;s apreciados en Mesopotamia. La expresi&#243;n musical de Mesopotamia es considerada origen de la cultura musical occidental.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la Antigua Grecia, la m&#250;sica se vio influenciada por todas las civilizaciones que la rodeaban, dada su importante posici&#243;n estrat&#233;gica. Culturas como la mesopot&#225;mica, etrusca, egipcia o incluso las indoeuropeas fueron de importante influencia tanto en sus m&#250;sicas como en sus instrumentos musicales. Los griegos daban mucha importancia al valor educativo y moral de la m&#250;sica. Por ello est&#225; muy relacionada con el poema &#233;pico. Aparecen los bardos o aedos que, acompa&#241;ados de una lira, vagan de pueblo en pueblo mendigando y guardando memoria oral de la historia de Grecia y sus leyendas. Fue entonces cuando se relacion&#243; la m&#250;sica estrechamente con la filosof&#237;a. Los sabios de la &#233;poca resaltan el valor cultural de la m&#250;sica. Pit&#225;goras la considera una medicina para el alma, y Arist&#243;teles la utiliza para llegar a la catarsis emocional.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Posteriormente aparece en Atenas el ditirambo, cantos dirigidos a Dionisos, acompa&#241;ados de danzas y el aul&#243;s, un instrumento parecido a la flauta. Surgen asimismo dramas, tragedias y comedias de una manera combinada pero sin perder la danza, la m&#250;sica y la poes&#237;a.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los principales instrumentos utilizados en Grecia fueron: la lira, la c&#237;tara, el aul&#243;s, la siringa (una flauta de pan), varios tipos de tambores como por ejemplo el tympanon (siempre en manos de mujeres), el cr&#243;talo, el c&#237;mbalo, el sistro, las casta&#241;uelas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Roma conquist&#243; Grecia, pero la cultura de esta era muy importante, y aunque ambas culturas se fundieron, Roma no aport&#243; nada a la m&#250;sica griega. Eso s&#237;, evolucion&#243; a la manera romana, variando en ocasiones su est&#233;tica. Habitualmente se utilizaba la m&#250;sica en las grandes fiestas. Eran muy valorados los m&#250;sicos virtuosos o famosos, a&#241;adiendo vertientes humor&#237;sticas y distendidas a sus actuaciones. Estos m&#250;sicos viv&#237;an de una manera bohemia, rodeados siempre de fiestas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En los teatros romanos o anfiteatros se representaban comedias al estilo griego. Los autores m&#225;s famosos fueron entre otros Plauto y Terencio. La tragedia tuvo trascendencia siendo su m&#225;ximo cultivador S&#233;neca. La m&#250;sica ten&#237;a un papel trascendental en estas obras teatrales.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A partir de la fundaci&#243;n de Roma sucede un hito musical, los ludiones. Estos eran unos actores de origen etrusco que bailaban al ritmo de la tibia (una especie de aul&#243;s). Los romanos intentan imitar estos artes y a&#241;aden el elemento de la m&#250;sica vocal. A estos nuevos artistas se les denomin&#243; histriones que significa bailarines en etrusco. Ninguna m&#250;sica de este estilo ha llegado hasta nosotros salvo un peque&#241;o fragmento de una comedia de Terencio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cuando el imperio romano se consolida, llega la inmigraci&#243;n que enriquece considerablemente la cultura romana. Fueron relevantes las aportaciones de Siria, Egipto y las que proven&#237;an de la Pen&#237;nsula Ib&#233;rica, actual Espa&#241;a. Vuelven a aparecer antiguos estilos como la citarodia (versos con c&#237;tara) y la citar&#237;stica (c&#237;tara sola virtuosa). Eran habituales los cert&#225;menes y competiciones en esta disciplina. Pese a todo esto, no est&#225; claro que Roma valorara institucional y culturalmente a la m&#250;sica.[NEWLINE]La m&#250;sica, como toda manifestaci&#243;n art&#237;stica, es un producto cultural. El fin de este arte es suscitar una experiencia est&#233;tica en el oyente, y expresar sentimientos, circunstancias, pensamientos o ideas. La m&#250;sica es un est&#237;mulo que afecta el campo perceptivo del individuo; as&#237;, el flujo sonoro puede cumplir con variadas funciones (entretenimiento, comunicaci&#243;n, ambientaci&#243;n, etc.).</Spanish>

		<English>Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek word of number) is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics, used by almost everyone, for tasks ranging from simple day-to-day counting to advanced science and business calculations. It involves the study of quantity, especially as the result of combining numbers. In common usage, it refers to the simpler properties when using the traditional operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with smaller values of numbers. The prehistory of arithmetic is limited to a very small number of small artifacts which may indicate conception of addition and subtraction, the best-known being the Ishango bone from central Africa, dating from somewhere between 20,000 and 18,000 BC although its interpretation is disputed. The earliest written records indicate the Egyptians and Babylonians used all the elementary arithmetic operations as early as 2000 BC. These artifacts do not always reveal the specific process used for solving problems, but the characteristics of the particular numeral system strongly influence the complexity of the methods. The hieroglyphic system for Egyptian numerals, like the later Roman numerals, descended from tally marks used for counting. In both cases, this origin resulted in values that used a decimal base but did not include positional notation. Although addition was generally straightforward, multiplication in Roman arithmetic required the assistance of a counting board to obtain the results. Early number systems that included positional notation were not decimal, including the sexagesimal (base 60) system for Babylonian numerals and the vigesimal(base 20) system that defined Maya numerals. Because of this place-value concept, the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation. The continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the Hellenistic civilization of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of Euclid around 300 BC, Greek studies in mathematics overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs. For example, Nicomachus summarized the viewpoint of the earlier Pythagorean approach to numbers, and their relationships to each other, in his Introduction to Arithmetic. Greek numerals, derived from the hieratic Egyptian system, also lacked positional notation, and therefore imposed the same complexity on the basic operations of arithmetic. For example, the ancient mathematician Archimedes devoted his entire work The Sand Reckoner merely to devising a notation for a certain large integer.</English>

In both cases, this origin resulted in values that used a decimal base but did not include positional notation. Although addition was generally straightforward, multiplication in Roman arithmetic required the assistance of a counting board to obtain the results. Early number systems that included positional notation were not decimal, including the sexagesimal (base 60) system for Babylonian numerals and the vigesimal(base 20) system that defined Maya numerals. Because of this place-value concept, the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation. The continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the Hellenistic civilization of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of Euclid around 300 BC, Greek studies in mathematics overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs. For example, Nicomachus summarized the viewpoint of the earlier Pythagorean approach to numbers, and their relationships to each other, in his Introduction to Arithmetic. Greek numerals, derived from the hieratic Egyptian system, also lacked positional notation, and therefore imposed the same complexity on the basic operations of arithmetic. For example, the ancient mathematician Archimedes devoted his entire work The Sand Reckoner merely to devising a notation for a certain large integer.</French>
		<German>Die Arithmetik (w&#246;rtlich die Zahlenm&#228;&#223;ige Kunst) ist ein Teilgebiet der Mathematik. Die Arithmetik wurde von den Pythagoreern begr&#252;ndet und in Buch VII-IX von Euklids Elementen erstmals gesammelt. Sie umfasst vor allem das Rechnen mit den Zahlen, also die Grundrechenarten Addition (Zusammenz&#228;hlen), Subtraktion (Abziehen), Multiplikation (Vervielfachen), Division (Teilen) sowie die zugeh&#246;rigen Rechengesetze. Zur Arithmetik geh&#246;ren auch die Gesetze der Teilbarkeit der ganzen Zahlen sowie die Division mit Rest. Weiter zu erw&#228;hnen ist das Rechnen mit Br&#252;chen. Fundamentalsatz der Arithmetik: Jede nat&#252;rliche Zahl gr&#246;&#223;er als 1 ist ein (bis auf die Reihenfolge) eindeutiges Produkt von Primzahlen. Die Arithmetik leitet zur Zahlentheorie &#252;ber, die sich im weitesten Sinn mit der Charakteristik der Zahlen besch&#228;ftigt.</German>
		<Italian>Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek word of number) is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics, used by almost everyone, for tasks ranging from simple day-to-day counting to advanced science and business calculations. It involves the study of quantity, especially as the result of combining numbers. In common usage, it refers to the simpler properties when using the traditional operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with smaller values of numbers. The prehistory of arithmetic is limited to a very small number of small artifacts which may indicate conception of addition and subtraction, the best-known being the Ishango bone from central Africa, dating from somewhere between 20,000 and 18,000 BC although its interpretation is disputed. The earliest written records indicate the Egyptians and Babylonians used all the elementary arithmetic operations as early as 2000 BC. These artifacts do not always reveal the specific process used for solving problems, but the characteristics of the particular numeral system strongly influence the complexity of the methods. The hieroglyphic system for Egyptian numerals, like the later Roman numerals, descended from tally marks used for counting.

		<Spanish>La aritm&#233;tica (del lat. arithmet&#301;cus, y este del gr. arithmi&#817;tik&#243;s, arithm&#243;s = n&#250;mero) es la rama de la matem&#225;tica cuyo objeto de estudio son los n&#250;meros y las operaciones elementales hechas con ellos: suma, resta, multiplicaci&#243;n y divisi&#243;n.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Al igual que en otras &#225;reas de la matem&#225;tica, como el &#225;lgebra o la geometr&#237;a, el sentido de la aritm&#233;tica ha ido evolucionando con el progresivo desarrollo de las ciencias. Originalmente, la aritm&#233;tica se desarrolla de manera formal en la Antigua Grecia, con el refinamiento del rigor matem&#225;tico y las demostraciones, y su extensi&#243;n a las distintas disciplinas de las ciencias naturales. En la actualidad, puede referirse a la aritm&#233;tica elemental, enfocada a la ense&#241;anza de la matem&#225;tica b&#225;sica; tambi&#233;n al conjunto que re&#250;ne el c&#225;lculo aritm&#233;tico y las operaciones matem&#225;ticas, espec&#237;ficamente, las cuatro operaciones b&#225;sicas aplicadas ya sea a n&#250;meros (naturales, fracciones, etc.) como a entidades matem&#225;ticas m&#225;s abstractas (matrices, operadores, etc); tambi&#233;n a la as&#237; llamada alta aritm&#233;tica, mejor conocida como teor&#237;a de n&#250;meros.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hay evidencias de que los babilonios ten&#237;an s&#243;lidos conocimientos de casi todos los aspectos de la aritm&#233;tica elemental hacia 1800 a. C., gracias a transcripciones de caracteres cuneiformes sobre tablillas de barro cocido, referidas a problemas de geometr&#237;a y astronom&#237;a. Solo se puede especular sobre los m&#233;todos utilizados para generar los resultados aritm&#233;ticos-tal y como se muestra, por ejemplo, en la tablilla de arcilla Plimpton 322, que parece ser una lista de ternas pitag&#243;ricas, pero sin mostrar c&#243;mo se gener&#243; la lista.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los antiguos textos Shulba-sutras (datados ca. 800 a.C y 200 a.C) recopilan los conocimientos matem&#225;ticos de la India durante el per&#237;odo v&#233;dico; constan de datos geom&#233;tricos relacionados con la construcci&#243;n de altares de fuego, e incluyen el problema de la cuadratura del c&#237;rculo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Otras civilizaciones mesopot&#225;micas, como sirios y fenicios, alcanzaron grados de desarrollo matem&#225;tico similar que utilizaron tanto para el comercio como para la resoluci&#243;n de ecuaciones algebraicas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El sistema de numeraci&#243;n egipcio, basado en fracciones unitarias, permit&#237;a efectuar cuentas aritm&#233;ticas avanzadas, como se muestra en papiros conservados como el Papiro de Mosc&#250; o el Papiro de Ahmes (que data de ca. 1650 a. C., aunque es una copia de un antiguo texto de ca. 1850 a. C.) que muestra sumas, restas, multiplicaciones y divisiones, utilizando un sistema de fracciones, as&#237; como los problemas de determinar el volumen de una esfera, o el volumen de una p&#237;r&#225;mide truncada. El papiro de Ahmes es el primer texto egipcio que menciona los 365 d&#237;as del calendario egipcio, es el primer calendario solar conocido.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La aritm&#233;tica en la Grecia Antigua era considerada como el estudio de las propiedades de los n&#250;meros, y no inclu&#237;a c&#225;lculos pr&#225;cticos, los m&#233;todos operatorios eran considerados una ciencia aparte. Esta particularidad fue heredada a los europeos durante la Edad Media, y no fue hasta el Renacimiento que la teor&#237;a de n&#250;meros y los m&#233;todos de c&#225;lculo comenzaron a considerarse aritm&#233;ticos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La matem&#225;tica griega hace una aguda diferencia entre el concepto de n&#250;mero y el de magnitud o conmensurabilidad. Para los antiguos griegos, n&#250;mero significaba lo que hoy se conoce por n&#250;mero natural, adem&#225;s de diferenciar entre n&#250;mero y magnitud geom&#233;trica. Los libros 7 &#8211; 9 de Los elementos de Euclides tratan de la aritm&#233;tica exclusivamente en este sentido.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nic&#243;maco de Gerasa (ca. 60-120 d. C.), en su Introducci&#243;n a la Aritm&#233;tica, resume la filosof&#237;a de Pit&#225;goras y de Plat&#243;n enfocada a los n&#250;meros y sus relaciones fundamentales. Nic&#243;maco hace por primera vez la diferencia expl&#237;cita entre M&#250;sica, Astronom&#237;a, Geometr&#237;a y Aritm&#233;tica, y le da a esta &#250;ltima un sentido m&#225;s moderno, es decir, referido a los n&#250;meros enteros y sus propiedades fundamentales.7 El quadrivium (lat. "cuatro caminos"), agrupaba estas cuatro disciplinas cient&#237;ficas relacionadas con las matem&#225;ticas provenientes de la escuela pitag&#243;rica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Diofanto de Alejandr&#237;a (siglo III d.C), es el autor de Arithmetica, una serie de libros sobre ecuaciones algebraicas en donde por primera vez se reconoce a las fracciones como n&#250;meros, y se utilizan s&#237;mbolos y variables como parte de la notaci&#243;n matem&#225;tica; redescubierto por Pierre de Fermat en el siglo XVII, las hoy llamadas ecuaciones diof&#225;nticas condujeron a un gran avance en la teor&#237;a de n&#250;meros.</Spanish>

		<English>There are a number of hypotheses on many of the key issues regarding the domestication of the horse. Although horses appeared in Paleolithic cave art as early as 30,000 BCE, these were truly wild horses and were probably hunted for meat. How and when horses became domesticated is disputed. The clearest evidence of early use of the horse as a means of transport is from chariot burials dated circa 2000 BCE. However, an increasing amount of evidence supports the hypothesis that horses were domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes (Dereivka centered in Ukraine) approximately 4000-3500 BCE. Recent discoveries on Botai culture suggest that Botai culture settlements in the Aqmola Province of Kazakhstan are the location of the earliest domestication of the horse. While riding may have been practiced during the 4th and 3rd millennia BCE, and the disappearance of "Old European" settlements may be related to attacks by horseback-mounted warriors, the clearest impact by horses on ancient warfare was by pulling chariots, introduced c. 2000 BCE. Horses in the Bronze Age were relatively small by modern standards, which led some theorists to believe the ancient horses were too small to be ridden and so must have been driven. Herodotus description of the Sigynnae, a steppe people who bred horses too small to ride but extremely efficient at drawing chariots, illustrates this stage. However, as horses remained generally smaller than modern equines well into the Middle Ages this theory is highly questionable. The Iron Age in Mesopotamia saw the rise of mounted cavalry as a tool of war, as evidenced by the notable successes of mounted archer tactics used by various invading equestrian nomads such as the Parthians. Over time, the chariot gradually become obsolete. The horse of the Iron Age was still relatively small, perhaps 12.2 to 14.2 hands high (1.27 to 1.47 meters, measured at the withers.) This was shorter overall average height than modern riding horses, which range from 14.2 to 17.2 hh (1.47 to 1.78 meters). However, small horses were used successfully as light cavalry for many centuries. For example, Fell ponies, believed to be descended from Roman cavalry horses, are comfortably able to carry fully grown adults (although with rather limited ground clearance) at an average height of 13.2 hands (1.37 m).</English>

		<German>Die Domestikation der Pferde begann vor etwa 5000 Jahren, als fr&#252;he Zivilisationen im Fernen Osten Pferde an menschliche N&#228;he gew&#246;hnten . Da aber auf H&#246;hlenmalereien bereits Zeichnungen gefunden wurden, welche eine Art Zaumzeug darstellen, ist es durchaus m&#246;glich, dass auch schon fr&#252;here Kulturen in der Lage gewesen sind, Pferdearten zu z&#228;hmen und f&#252;r ihre Zwecke zu gebrauchen. Die Begegnung Mensch-Pferd begann sicherlich durch die Jagd. Im Verlauf der Zeit wurden dann die ersten Pferde gefangen und gez&#228;hmt. Schnell merkte der Mensch, dass er Pferde f&#252;r die Bef&#246;rderung von Waren und anderen Gegenst&#228;nden gut einsetzen konnte. So wurde aus dem wegen seines Fleisches gejagten Pferd das domestizierte Packpferd. Geritten wurden Pferde wohl als erstes von den Persern, die bereits 500 v. Chr. schon &#252;ber eine m&#228;chtige Kavallerie verf&#252;gten. Ihre Gegner benutzen die Pferde damals noch &#252;berwiegend zum Ziehen der schweren Kampfwagen.</German>

		<Spanish>Aunque la domesticaci&#243;n del caballo ocurri&#243; varias veces a lo largo de la historia, la evidencia arqueol&#243;gica disponible ubica su primera aparici&#243;n alrededor de a&#241;o 3.500 aC en la regi&#243;n de Ukrania y Kazajist&#225;n . La tecnolog&#237;a se difundi&#243; luego por las praderas y estepas eurasi&#225;ticas que van del Mar Caspio casi hasta el R&#237;o Amarillo de China, regi&#243;n donde estaba la Ruta de la Seda. Los numerosos pueblos que all&#237; habitaron a trav&#233;s del tiempo &#8211; botai, escitas, cimerios, s&#225;rmatas, hunos, siung-nu y mongoles, entre otros &#8211; eran originalmente cazadores y pastores de reba&#241;os. El historiador griego Her&#243;doto describe como los escitas hab&#237;an esclavizado a todas las restantes tribus de la Rusia meridional; otros pueblos han sido estudiados por los arque&#243;logos. El uso de los caballos como cabalgadura permiti&#243; a los pueblos cazadores la captura de presas m&#225;s grandes y r&#225;pidas, como el alce y el bisonte, que antes estaban fuera de sus posibilidades. A los pueblos pastores les permiti&#243; aumentar la cantidad de ganado que controlaban y ampliar su radio de acci&#243;n para seleccionar mejores campos de pastura, con el consiguiente incremento del n&#250;mero y peso de sus animales. Ambos pod&#237;an cazar nuevos caballos salvajes, en un importante proceso multiplicativo de sus nuevas posibilidades. En ambos casos mejor&#243; mucho la satisfacci&#243;n de las necesidades alimentarias y se aceler&#243; el crecimiento de sus poblaciones.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Al disminuir el tiempo necesario para la resoluci&#243;n de sus necesidades de alimentaci&#243;n, pudieron emplearlo en otras tareas. Las t&#233;cnicas de la caza son la preparaci&#243;n natural para la guerra porque desarrollan la capacidad de usar m&#225;s eficientemente armas mortales, inicialmente en animales, luego en otras personas. Tanto la econom&#237;a de la caza como la pastoril requieren la preservaci&#243;n de los territorios que se usufruct&#250;an. La ampliaci&#243;n de los radios de acci&#243;n, m&#225;s tarde o m&#225;s temprano, hizo que los pueblos de jinetes entraran en conflicto con los de otras tribus, conflicto que en general conduc&#237;a a la guerra. Al mismo tiempo, al pasar cada vez m&#225;s tiempo lejos de los asentamientos estables de los grupos de su propia tribu que se dedicaban a las tareas agr&#237;colas, necesariamente sedentarias, los v&#237;nculos con ellos se fueron debilitando. El &#233;xito en la guerra hecho posible por el uso del caballo, m&#225;s tarde o m&#225;s temprano condujo a la opresi&#243;n de los agricultores pac&#237;ficos, primero de otras tribus, luego de la propia. El caballo exacerb&#243; as&#237; el car&#225;cter guerrero de estos pueblos y modific&#243; completamente su estructura social. Cuando la tecnolog&#237;a de domesticaci&#243;n del caballo se extendi&#243;, en alg&#250;n momento los n&#243;madas guerreros que la practicaban tuvieron m&#225;s en com&#250;n entre s&#237; que con las culturas de las que originalmente proced&#237;an. Estos pueblos n&#243;madas, cuyos herederos mongoles todav&#237;a habitan las estepas eurasi&#225;ticas, son los que conquistaron la China y socavaron los cimiento del Imperio Romano. </Spanish>

		<English>A codex (Latin caudex for "trunk of a tree" or block of wood) is a book in the format used for modern books, with multiple quires or gatherings (sheets of paper or vellum in multiples of two which are folded and stitched through) typically bound together and given a cover. Developed by the Romans from wooden writing tablets, its gradual replacement of the scroll, the dominant form of book in the ancient world, has been termed the most important advance in the history of the book prior to the invention of printing. The spread of the codex is often associated with the rise of Christianity, which adopted the format for the Bible early on. First described by the 1st-century AD Roman poet Martial, who praised its convenient use, the codex achieved numerical parity with the scroll around AD 300, and had completely replaced it throughout the now Christianised Greco-Roman world by the 6th century. The codex holds considerable practical advantages over other book formats, such as compactness, sturdiness, ease of reference (a codex is random access, as opposed to a scroll, which is sequential access), and especially economy; unlike the scroll, both recto and verso could be used for writing. Although the change from rolls to codices roughly coincides with the transition from papyrus to parchment as favourite writing material, the two developments are quite unconnected. In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls on the one hand with papyrus and parchment on the other is technically feasible and well attested from the historical record. The Romans used precursors made of reusable wax-covered tablets of wood for taking notes and other informal writings. Two ancient polyptychs, a pentatych and octotych, excavated at Herculaneum employed a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on thongs or cords. At the turn of of the 1st century CE, a kind of folded parchment notebook called pugillares membranei in Latin became commonly used for writing in the Roman Empire. This term was used by both the pagan poet Martial and Christian apostle Paul the Apostle. Martial used the term with reference to gifts of literature exchanged by Romans during the festival of Saturnalia. According to T.C. Skeat in at least three cases and probably in all, in the form of codices" and he theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then must have spread rapidly to the Near East In his discussion of one of the earliest pagan parchment codices to survive from Oxyrhynchus in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeats notion when stating its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory and that early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt. Early codices of parchment or papyrus appear to have been widely used as personal notebooks, for instance in recording copies of letters sent (Cicero Fam. 9.26.1). The pages of parchment notebooks were commonly washed or scraped for re-use, called a palimpsest; and consequently writings in a codex were considered informal and impermanent. The codex also made it easier to organize documents in a library because it had a stable spine on which the title of the book could be written. The spine could be used for the incipit, before the concept of a proper title was developed, during medieval times. Although most early codices were made of papyrus, papyrus was fragile and supplies from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew and was made into paper, became scanty; the more durable parchment and vellum gained favor, despite the cost.</English>

		<German>Kodex (lateinisch codex, "Baumstamm"; Mehrzahl codices, daher eingedeutscht auch Kodizes) bezeichnet urspr&#252;nglich einen Stapel beschrifteter oder zur Beschriftung vorgesehener Holz- oder Wachstafeln, sp&#228;ter den von zwei Holzbrettchen umschlossenen Block gefalteter oder gehefteter Papyrus- oder (meistens) Pergamentbl&#228;tter. In der r&#246;mischen Kaiserzeit war der Kodex neben der &#228;lteren Buchform der Rolle in Gebrauch, bevor er sich seit dem 4. Jahrhundert n. Chr. als die f&#252;hrende Buchform der Sp&#228;tantike durchsetzte, die sich bis in die Neuzeit nicht mehr wesentlich ver&#228;ndert hat. Mit der Abl&#246;sung der Rolle durch den Kodex wurde als Beschreibmaterial der Papyrus zunehmend durch das edlere und teurere, jedoch nicht von Importen abh&#228;ngige Pergament ersetzt. Die bequemere Handhabung sowie das vereinfachte Nachschlagen von Parallelstellen im Rahmen der Bibelexegese waren Vorz&#252;ge des Kodex. W&#228;hrend sich im alten &#196;gypten Schreibtafeln aus der Zeit der Pharaonen erhalten haben und im Nahen Osten Tafeln gefunden wurden, die mindestens aus dem 8. vorchristlichen Jahrhundert stammen, sind im archaischen und klassischen Griechenland Schreibtafeln nur indirekt (bildlich, literarisch oder inschriftlich) bezeugt. Die &#228;ltesten erhaltenen Tafeln (griech.: pinakes) mit griechischer Beschriftung stammen aus hellenistischer Zeit. In Griechenland blieb die Verwendung im wesentlichen auf Dokumentenarchivierung und Alltagsnotizen beschr&#228;nkt.

First described by the 1st-century AD Roman poet Martial, who praised its convenient use, the codex achieved numerical parity with the scroll around AD 300, and had completely replaced it throughout the now Christianised Greco-Roman world by the 6th century. The codex holds considerable practical advantages over other book formats, such as compactness, sturdiness, ease of reference (a codex is random access, as opposed to a scroll, which is sequential access), and especially economy; unlike the scroll, both recto and verso could be used for writing. Although the change from rolls to codices roughly coincides with the transition from papyrus to parchment as favourite writing material, the two developments are quite unconnected. In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls on the one hand with papyrus and parchment on the other is technically feasible and well attested from the historical record. The Romans used precursors made of reusable wax-covered tablets of wood for taking notes and other informal writings. Two ancient polyptychs, a pentatych and octotych, excavated at Herculaneum employed a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on thongs or cords. At the turn of of the 1st century CE, a kind of folded parchment notebook called pugillares membranei in Latin became commonly used for writing in the Roman Empire. This term was used by both the pagan poet Martial and Christian apostle Paul the Apostle. Martial used the term with reference to gifts of literature exchanged by Romans during the festival of Saturnalia. According to T.C. Skeat in at least three cases and probably in all, in the form of codices" and he theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then must have spread rapidly to the Near East In his discussion of one of the earliest pagan parchment codices to survive from Oxyrhynchus in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeats notion when stating its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory and that early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt. Early codices of parchment or papyrus appear to have been widely used as personal notebooks, for instance in recording copies of letters sent (Cicero Fam. 9.26.1). The pages of parchment notebooks were commonly washed or scraped for re-use, called a palimpsest; and consequently writings in a codex were considered informal and impermanent. The codex also made it easier to organize documents in a library because it had a stable spine on which the title of the book could be written. The spine could be used for the incipit, before the concept of a proper title was developed, during medieval times. Although most early codices were made of papyrus, papyrus was fragile and supplies from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew and was made into paper, became scanty; the more durable parchment and vellum gained favor, despite the cost.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Se denomina c&#243;dice (del lat&#237;n codex, -icis, 'tablilla de madera encerada para escribir' y posteriormente 'libro') a un documento con el formato de los libros modernos, de p&#225;ginas separadas, unidas juntas por una encuadernada. Aunque t&#233;cnicamente cualquier libro moderno es un c&#243;dice, este secundario t&#233;rmino latino se utiliza com&#250;nmente para libros escritos a mano, manufacturados en el periodo que abarca desde finales de la Antig&#252;edad precl&#225;sica hasta el fin de la Edad Media.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Etimol&#243;gicamente, procede del caldeo caudex ('tabla') y de este al lat&#237;n caudex, -icis ('tronco') que contrajo el diptongo en codex, nombre que dieron los romanos a la tablilla de cera para escribir y por desplazamiento sem&#225;ntico metaf&#243;rico en los inicios del cristianismo design&#243; al libro en su formato actual, con p&#225;ginas, distinto al de los rollos empleado hasta entonces.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Desde el siglo II, los c&#243;dices comenzaron a sustituir a los rollos, aunque estos &#250;ltimos todav&#237;a se utilizaron de manera aislada hasta el siglo IV.

		<English>Veterinary medicine is the branch of science that deals with the application of medical, surgical, public health, dental, diagnostic, and therapeutic principles to non-human animals, including wildlife and domesticated animals, including livestock, working animals, and companion animals. Practitioners of veterinary medicine are known as veterinarians. Veterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of zoonotic disease (infectious disease transmitted from non-human animals to humans). The Egyptian "Papyrus of Kahun" (1900 BCE) and Vedic literature in ancient India offer one of the first written records of veterinary medicine. One of the edicts of Ashoka reads: "Everywhere King Piyadasi (Asoka) erected two kinds of hospitals, hospitals for people and hospitals for animals. Where there were no healing herbs for people and animals, he ordered that they be bought and planted." The Talmud does state that no mares were exported from Egypt in Roman times without being subjected to a hysterectomy, which tend to prove that successful surgery was implemented in such an early period.</English>

		<German>Urspr&#252;nglich haben sich Tier- und Humanmedizin in den gleichen Bahnen entwickelt. Mediziner praktizierten lange Zeit in beiden Disziplinen. In der Antike st&#252;tzte sich die Medizin auf ihr empirisches Wissen und auf die Botanik; ihr haftete der Mythos geheimnisvoller Kr&#228;fte an. Bei den Methoden wurde nicht wirklich zwischen solchen f&#252;r den Menschen und solchen f&#252;r das Tier unterschieden. Und doch fand man bei den &#196;gyptern auf einem Papyrus aus dem Jahr 1750 v.Chr. Spuren einer eigens auf Tiere ausgerichteten Wissenschaft, es handelt von der Augenheilkunde f&#252;r das Tier. An den Mauern der Grabst&#228;tten finden sich Fresken, die das Kalben sowie die Pflege der Rinderhufe darstellen. Es scheint sogar, dass sich in einer bestimmten Kaste Tiermediziner zusammengefunden haben. Nat&#252;rlich kamen die neusten Erkenntnisse jener Zeit in erster Linie den heiligen Tieren zugute. Die Griechen waren die ersten, welche die medizinische Wissenschaft entscheidend vorangetrieben haben. Um 400 v.Chr. entwickelte Hippokrates eine pragmatische Medizin mit Befragung und systematischer Untersuchung der Kranken. Auf ihn sollen auch die ersten verschriebenen Arzneimittel zur&#252;ckgehen. Platon, Herophilos und Galienus traten sp&#228;ter in seine Fu&#223;stapfen. Jeder von ihnen widmete sich der Beschreibung der Krankheiten von Menschen und manchmal auch von Tieren. Hippokrates beispielsweise befasste sich mit Gehirnst&#246;rungen bei Rindern und Schafen. Aber erst durch Aristoteles entstand eine systematische Lehre der Tierpathologie. Er hat die bekanntesten Erkrankungen beschrieben: Tollwut, Schweinerotlauf, Pferdekoliken. Er besch&#228;ftigte sich sogar mit Elefanten. Seine Erkenntnisse und Aufzeichnungen dienten an der ber&#252;hmten Schule f&#252;r Medizin in Alexandria als Arbeitsgrundlage. W&#228;hrend der ganzen Antike wurden die Bestrebungen, die Tiermedizin voranzutreiben, haupts&#228;chlich von der Bedeutung der milit&#228;rischen Kavallerie bestimmt, die das notwendige Instrument f&#252;r die gro&#223;en Eroberungsz&#252;ge der damaligen Zeit darstellte. Hinzu kamen die h&#228;ufigen Epidemien, welche die Viehherden dezimierten. Es wurden Texte gefunden, die von der Rinderpest in Griechenland sowie im byzantinischen Reich berichten. Das Mittelalter brachte einen Niedergang der Wissenschaften mit sich, die Tiermedizin war davon nicht ausgenommen. Instrumente und Methoden wurden kaum weiter entwickelt. Aderlass, Klistiere, Ver&#228;tzungen, Punktionen, Essig und Salz geh&#246;rten wieder zu den empfohlenen Behandlungsmethoden. Nur die Araber verstanden es, auf der Grundlage der Werke von Hippokrates und Galienus ihre wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse voranzutreiben. Sie entwickelten verschiedene Skalpell-Arten sowie Methoden zur Fixierung von Knochenfrakturen bei Pferden.</German>

		<German>Das Glashandwerk im pharaonischen &#196;gypten l&#228;sst sich bis an den Beginn der 18. Dynastie zur&#252;ckverfolgen; zun&#228;chst handelt es sich dabei um Kleinfunde wie Perlen, Amulette oder Kettenglieder sowie farbigen Einlagen in den typischen &#228;gyptischen Schmuckobjekten (z.B. Pektorale). Diese sind meist in t&#252;rkis oder dunkelblau gehalten, da sie solche Objekte aus Lapislazuli oder T&#252;rkis imitieren sollten; dies galt nicht als "billiger Schmuck", sondern die Imitation dieser edlen, hoch machtgeladenen Steine galt als besondere "Kunst". In der Ersten &#228;gyptischen Glaskunstbl&#252;te (18. bis 20. Dynastie) treten sogenannte stabgeformte Gef&#228;&#223;e auf. Typische Formen &#228;gyptischer Glasgef&#228;&#223;e sind Lotoskelchbecher, Granatapfelgef&#228;&#223;e, Krateriskoi und Schminkgef&#228;&#223;e wie Kohlt&#246;pfe und Kohlpalms&#228;ulchen (f&#252;r schwarze Augenschminke, sprich "kochel"). Seit Thutmosis III., aus dessen Regierungszeit auch die &#228;ltesten Hohlglasfunde stammen, treten auch Importgef&#228;&#223;formen aus dem Mittelmeergebiet hinzu. Die &#228;lteren kerngeformten Gef&#228;&#223;e (etwa in der Zeit Thutmosis III. bis Amenophis III.) sind meistens t&#252;rkis- bis kr&#228;ftig blau (wie der echte T&#252;rkis und Lapislazuli, denn Glas galt als Imitation dieser edlen Steine). Sp&#228;ter, besonders in der Ramessidenzeit, werden Gl&#228;ser in hellen, kr&#228;ftigen Farben wie gelb und gr&#252;n, wei&#223; aber auch braun beliebt. Als Dekor sieht man Fadenverzierungen in Zickzack- oder Girlandenform in gelb, wei&#223;, und hellblau sowie tordierte F&#228;den im Hell-Dunkel-Kontrast, manchmal werden sie auch monochrom belassen und nur die Henkel oder Schulterumbr&#252;che durch Fadenzier betont. Die &#228;gyptischen Glasgef&#228;&#223;e dienten der Aufbewahrung von Kosmetika wie Salben, &#214;len, Parf&#252;men und Augenschminke. Das stark gef&#228;rbte, undurchsichtige Glas wirkte konservierend. Im r&#246;mischen Reich im 1.Jh. stieg die Glasproduktion derart, dass das vormals rare und teure Material f&#252;r weite Kreise erschwinglich wurde. Eine umfangreiche Produktion von Trinkgef&#228;&#223;en, Kr&#252;gen, Schalen und Tellern setzte ein, anfangs meist get&#246;pfert oder abgesenkt, dann zunehmend mundgeblasen. Eine Vielzahl hochwertiger Spezialgl&#228;ser beweist handwerkliche Meisterschaft, so die Mosaik-Fadengl&#228;ser, Kameogl&#228;ser, Goldfoliengl&#228;ser, Gl&#228;ser mit Emailmalerei und besonders die Diatretgl&#228;ser, meist glockenf&#246;rmige, prunkvolle Leuchtgef&#228;&#223;e in Netzglastechnik, die bis heute wegen ihrer k&#252;nstlerischen Qualit&#228;t bewundert werden.</German>

		<English>An alphabet is a standardized set of letters-basic written symbols or graphemes-each of which roughly represents a phoneme in a spoken language, either as it exists now or as it was in the past. There are other systems, such as logographies, in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit, and syllabaries, in which each character represents a syllable. The word "alphabet" came into Middle English from the Late Latin word Alphabetum, which in turn originated in the Ancient Greek Alphabetos, from alpha and beta, the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha and beta in turn came from the first two letters of the Phoenician alphabet, and meant ox and house respectively and the first three letters of the Arabic language "Alef, ?", "Ba, ?", and "Ta, ?". There are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most common being Latin, deriving from the first true alphabet, Greek. The history of the alphabet is believed to have begun in Ancient Egypt, more than a millennium into the history of writing. The first consonantal alphabet found has emerged around 2000 BCE to represent the language of Semitic workers in Egypt, and was at least influenced by the alphabetic principles of the Egyptian hieratic script. Nearly all alphabets in the world today either descend directly from this development or were inspired by its design. Two scripts are well attested from before the end of the fourth millennium BCE: Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Both were well known in the part of the Middle East that produced the first widely used alphabet, the Phoenician. There are signs that cuneiform was developing alphabetic properties in some of the languages it was adapted for, as was seen again later in the Old Persian cuneiform script, but it now appears these developments were a sideline and not ancestral to the alphabet. The Byblos syllabary has suggestive graphic similarities to both hieratic Egyptian and to the Phoenician alphabet, but as it is undeciphered, little can be said about its role, if any, in the history of the alphabet. By 2700 BCE the ancient Egyptians had developed a set of some 22 hieroglyphs to represent the individual consonants of their language, plus a 23rd that seems to have represented word-initial or word-final vowels. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names. However, although alphabetic in nature, the system was not used for purely alphabetic writing except when transcribing foreign names. That is, while capable of being used as an alphabet, it was in fact nearly always used with a strong logographic component, presumably due to strong cultural attachment to the complex Egyptian script. A Semitic language is attested in Egyptian hieroglyphs from 2400 BCE, but glyphs have their Egyptian values and so were not ancestral to the alphabet. The first purely alphabetic script is thought to have been developed around 1850 BCE for Semitic workers in the Sinai but giving mostly Egyptian glyphs Semitic values. Over the next five centuries it spread north, and all subsequent alphabets around the world have either descended from it, or been inspired by one of its descendants, with the possible exception of the Meroitic alphabet, a 3rd century BCE adaptation of hieroglyphs in Nubia to the south of Egypt-though even here many scholars suspect the influence of that first alphabet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]India[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sanskrit is a historical Indo-Aryan language, the primary liturgical language of Hinduism and a literary and scholarly language in Jainism and Buddhism. Its position in the cultures of Greater India is akin to that of Latin and Greek in Europe and it has significantly influenced most modern languages of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal. The pre-Classical form of Sanskrit is known as Vedic Sanskrit, with the language of the Rigveda being the oldest and most archaic stage preserved, its oldest core dating back to as early as 1500 BCE. This qualifies Rigvedic Sanskrit as one of the oldest attestations of any Indo-Iranian language, and one of the earliest attested members of the Indo-European language family, the family which includes English and most European languages. The corpus of Sanskrit literature encompasses a rich tradition of poetry and drama as well as scientific, technical, philosophical and dharma texts. Sanskrit continues to be widely used as a ceremonial language in Hindu religious rituals and Buddhist practice in the forms of hymns and mantras.

		<German>Als Buchstabenschrift bezeichnet man ein Schriftsystem, dem die Phoneme (Laute) einer Sprache als diskrete Zeicheneinheiten zugrunde liegen. Diese Einheiten, meist handelt es sich um etwa 20 bis 40 verschiedene Zeichen, werden als Buchstaben bezeichnet. Sie haben keine semantische Bedeutung und lassen sich in ihrer Gesamtheit in einem Alphabet zusammenfassen. Jede alphabetische Schrift ist eine phonographische Schrift, deren Prinzip am strengsten von der Lautschrift vertreten wird: Ein Zeichen bezeichnet einen Sprachlaut. Den Gegensatz dazu bilden die Silbenschriften, die auf visualisierten Silben (Lautkombinationen) basieren, und die logographischen Schriften, die Zeichen f&#252;r semantische Einheiten (W&#246;rter, Begriffe, Ideen) kennen. Die fr&#252;hesten Zeugnisse einer Schrift werden allgemein den Sumerern (ca. 3500 v. Chr.) zugeschrieben. Sie benutzten logographische Zeichen und eine Keilschrift f&#252;r Verwaltungszwecke. Um etwa 1500 v. Chr. entwickelten im &#246;stlichen Mittelmeerraum die Ph&#246;nizier die Ph&#246;nizische Schrift, von der alle sp&#228;teren Alphabetschriften und mithin alle modernen europ&#228;ischen Alphabete, einschlie&#223;lich des griechischen, lateinischen und des kyrillischen, abstammen. Die fr&#252;hesten Einritzungen, hinter denen nach Gimbutas und Haarmann eine Schrift im eigentlichen Sinne zu vermuten sein k&#246;nnte, stammen aus der alteurop&#228;ischen Vinca-Kultur im Raum des heutigen Serbien. Die Interpretation dieser Funde aus dem 6. bis 5. Jahrtausend v. Chr. als Schrift ist jedoch zweifelhaft. Die &#228;ltesten nachweislichen Schriftfunde stammen aus den T&#228;lern von Euphrat und Tigris (Mesopotamien); dabei handelt es sich zun&#228;chst um eine Bilderschrift (ab etwa 3500 v. Chr.) sowie eine Keilschrift, die auf Tontafeln festgehalten wurde. Etwas sp&#228;ter, um 3200 v. Chr., entstanden die &#228;gyptischen Hieroglyphen, dann um 2300 bis 2000 v. Chr. die akkadische Silbenschrift sowie um 1700 v. Chr. schlie&#223;lich die ph&#246;nizische Buchstabenschrift; hier wurden erstmals alle Einzelkonsonanten mit rund 30 Zeichen visualisiert. Die alphabetische Schrift wurde zwischen 1500 und 1200 v. Chr. von den Ph&#246;niziern aus der &#228;gyptischen hieratischen Schrift entwickelt; dabei entstand zun&#228;chst eine reine Konsonantenschrift. Die Struktur der semitischen Sprachen (Wort-Radikale aus drei Konsonanten) d&#252;rfte diesen Vorgang beg&#252;nstigt haben. Ab etwa 900 v. Chr. wurde die alphabetische Schrift von den Aram&#228;ern weiterentwickelt. Die Moabiter und pal&#228;stinischen Ph&#246;nizier f&#252;gten einige Vokalbuchstaben hinzu. Die Schrift der Hebr&#228;er leitet sich ebenfalls von der der Ph&#246;nizier ab. Sp&#228;testens um 800 v. Chr. &#252;bernahmen die Griechen das Alphabet von den Ph&#246;niziern. Sie f&#252;gten Buchstaben f&#252;r alle Vokale hinzu, d. h., in Griechenland entstand das erste vollst&#228;ndige phonetische Alphabet, das alle Konsonanten und Vokale visualisierte. Die &#214;ffnung der &#228;gyptischen H&#228;fen f&#252;r die Griechen im Jahre 670 v. Chr. und die Gr&#252;ndung Naukratis 650 v. Chr. hatten den Zugang f&#252;r Papyrus erleichtert, was zu einem explosionsartigen Anstieg von lyrischer Dichtung f&#252;hrtem. Zwischen 404 und 403 v. Chr. wurde in Athen das ionische Alphabet &#252;bernommen. Durch ein vereinfachtes, flexibles Alphabet und die Zunahme an Schreib- und Lesekundigen r&#252;ckte logisches Denken und somit allgemeine &#220;bereinkunft in den Vordergrund.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Indien[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Das Sanskrit bezeichnet die kodifizierte Form des Alt-Indischen. Oft wird Sanskrit auch f&#252;r die unbearbeitete, m&#252;ndlich &#252;berlieferte vedische Sprache verwendet. Sie spielt vor allem im Hinduismus eine wesentliche Rolle. Sanskrit ist die klassische Sprache der Brahmanen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Die Entstehung wird auf 1200 v. Chr. datiert, das zu dieser Zeit &#252;bliche Vedische unterscheidet sich jedoch noch vom klassischen Sanskrit. Beim Sprachausbau des Hindi kam es zu Entlehnungen aus dem Sanskrit. Das moderne Sanskrit, welches laut Zensus von einigen Indern als Muttersprache angegeben wird, ist immer noch die heilige Sprache der Hindus, da alle religi&#246;sen Schriften von den Veden und Upanishaden bis zur Bhagavad-Gita auf Sanskrit verfasst wurden und h&#228;ufig auch so vorgetragen werden. Auch f&#252;r religi&#246;se Rituale wie Gottesdienste, Hochzeiten und Totenrituale ist sie noch heute unerl&#228;sslich.</German>
		<Italian>An alphabet is a standardized set of letters-basic written symbols or graphemes-each of which roughly represents a phoneme in a spoken language, either as it exists now or as it was in the past. There are other systems, such as logographies, in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit, and syllabaries, in which each character represents a syllable. The word "alphabet" came into Middle English from the Late Latin word Alphabetum, which in turn originated in the Ancient Greek Alphabetos, from alpha and beta, the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. Alpha and beta in turn came from the first two letters of the Phoenician alphabet, and meant ox and house respectively and the first three letters of the Arabic language "Alef, ?", "Ba, ?", and "Ta, ?". There are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most common being Latin, deriving from the first true alphabet, Greek. The history of the alphabet is believed to have begun in Ancient Egypt, more than a millennium into the history of writing. The first consonantal alphabet found has emerged around 2000 BCE to represent the language of Semitic workers in Egypt, and was at least influenced by the alphabetic principles of the Egyptian hieratic script. Nearly all alphabets in the world today either descend directly from this development or were inspired by its design. Two scripts are well attested from before the end of the fourth millennium BCE: Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Both were well known in the part of the Middle East that produced the first widely used alphabet, the Phoenician. There are signs that cuneiform was developing alphabetic properties in some of the languages it was adapted for, as was seen again later in the Old Persian cuneiform script, but it now appears these developments were a sideline and not ancestral to the alphabet. The Byblos syllabary has suggestive graphic similarities to both hieratic Egyptian and to the Phoenician alphabet, but as it is undeciphered, little can be said about its role, if any, in the history of the alphabet. By 2700 BCE the ancient Egyptians had developed a set of some 22 hieroglyphs to represent the individual consonants of their language, plus a 23rd that seems to have represented word-initial or word-final vowels. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names. However, although alphabetic in nature, the system was not used for purely alphabetic writing except when transcribing foreign names. That is, while capable of being used as an alphabet, it was in fact nearly always used with a strong logographic component, presumably due to strong cultural attachment to the complex Egyptian script. A Semitic language is attested in Egyptian hieroglyphs from 2400 BCE, but glyphs have their Egyptian values and so were not ancestral to the alphabet. The first purely alphabetic script is thought to have been developed around 1850 BCE for Semitic workers in the Sinai but giving mostly Egyptian glyphs Semitic values. Over the next five centuries it spread north, and all subsequent alphabets around the world have either descended from it, or been inspired by one of its descendants, with the possible exception of the Meroitic alphabet, a 3rd century BCE adaptation of hieroglyphs in Nubia to the south of Egypt-though even here many scholars suspect the influence of that first alphabet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]India[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sanskrit is a historical Indo-Aryan language, the primary liturgical language of Hinduism and a literary and scholarly language in Jainism and Buddhism. Its position in the cultures of Greater India is akin to that of Latin and Greek in Europe and it has significantly influenced most modern languages of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal. The pre-Classical form of Sanskrit is known as Vedic Sanskrit, with the language of the Rigveda being the oldest and most archaic stage preserved, its oldest core dating back to as early as 1500 BCE. This qualifies Rigvedic Sanskrit as one of the oldest attestations of any Indo-Iranian language, and one of the earliest attested members of the Indo-European language family, the family which includes English and most European languages. The corpus of Sanskrit literature encompasses a rich tradition of poetry and drama as well as scientific, technical, philosophical and dharma texts. Sanskrit continues to be widely used as a ceremonial language in Hindu religious rituals and Buddhist practice in the forms of hymns and mantras. Spoken Sanskrit is still in use in a few traditional institutions in India and there are many attempts at revival.</Italian>
		<Spanish>El alfabeto, abecedario o abec&#233; de una lengua o idioma es el conjunto ordenado de sus letras. Es tambi&#233;n la agrupaci&#243;n, con un orden determinado, de las graf&#237;as utilizadas para representar el lenguaje que sirve de sistema de comunicaci&#243;n.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El t&#233;rmino alfabeto procede del griego alf&#225;beton, derivado de las dos primeras letras griegas alfa y beta, derivadas a su vez de las letras fenicias alp y bet, que significaban 'buey' y 'casa' respectivamente. El alfabeto griego es una adaptaci&#243;n del alfabeto fenicio, que tambi&#233;n dio lugar entre otros al hebreo y al &#225;rabe. Por su parte, el t&#233;rmino abecedario proviene del lat&#237;n tard&#237;o abeced&#257;rium, tambi&#233;n derivado del nombre de las primeras letras, en este caso cuatro: a (a), b (be), c (ce) y d (de).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Algunas letras pueden recibir uno o varios diacr&#237;ticos con el fin de diferenciar los sonidos de la lengua o poder evitar las ambig&#252;edades. De la misma forma, el alfabeto puede ser entendido por el uso de letras suplementarias. Las evoluciones fon&#233;ticas de una lengua se crean a un ritmo diferente de la evoluci&#243;n escrita. La escritura alfab&#233;tica no garantiza una correspondencia un&#237;voca entre los fonemas y los grafemas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En otros &#225;mbitos (matem&#225;ticas, por ejemplo), un alfabeto es un conjunto finito y ordenado de s&#237;mbolos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los principales alfabetos occidentales han tenido su origen en el alfabeto sem&#237;tico septentrional o cananeo, datado hace m&#225;s de 3500 a&#241;os, entre el 1700 y el 1500 a. C., en el Pr&#243;ximo Oriente.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El precedente del alfabeto occidental se ide&#243; en las regiones orientales de la costa mediterr&#225;nea y se encargaron de divulgarlo los mercaderes fenicios. Probablemente los griegos conocieron este sistema de escritura en la ciudad Gibl (en el L&#237;bano de hoy), un importante centro cultural y de comercio que llamaron Biblos; lo adoptaron en Grecia, aunque transformaron algunas consonantes y semiconsonantes en vocales. Tambi&#233;n variaron la direcci&#243;n de algunas letras y generalizaron el escribir de izquierda a derecha. Se suele fechar hacia el 900 a. C..[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El alfabeto griego adopt&#243; el fenicio y modific&#243; el valor de ciertos sonidos conson&#225;nticos y design&#243; las vocales. Del griego proceden el alfabeto g&#243;tico, copto, armenio, georgiano, alban&#233;s, eslavo (glagol&#237;tico y cir&#237;lico) y etrusco.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El alfabeto latino es uno de los alfabetos locales que los etruscos tomaron del griego. Se diferencia de &#233;ste no s&#243;lo en la forma de las letras, sino tambi&#233;n en su empleo. En el siglo I de nuestra era estaba constituido por 23 letras. Con la expansi&#243;n de la civilizaci&#243;n grecolatina y del cristianismo, el alfabeto latino termin&#243; por conquistar toda Europa: celtas, eslavos, germanos, escandinavos, etc. escriben con las letras latinas. Este alfabeto, adaptado por los romanos con las variantes propias, se difundi&#243; por todo el Mediterr&#225;neo, y posteriormente a todo Occidente.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los alfabetos ib&#233;ricos parecen haberse derivado del fenicio y griego.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El alfabeto de los pueblos germ&#225;nicos, llamado futhark (las runas y los oghams) por el nombre de sus seis primeras letras, se redujo de 26 signos a 16.

		<English>A composite bow is a bow made from disparate materials laminated together, usually applied under tension. Different materials are used in order to take advantage of the properties of each material. Bows of any kind seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian laminated bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy, and it is not possible to reconstruct the details of the process by which composite bows became a usual weapon among all Asiatic nomads. It is also not clear that the various developments of the composite bow led to measurable improvements; "the development of archery equipment may not be a process involving progressive improvements in performance. Rather, each design type represents one solution to the problem of creating a mobile weapon system capable of hurling lightweight projectiles." The first appearance of composite bows coincides approximately with the adoption of the horse to draw chariots or as a riding animal. Variants of the Scythian bow were the dominant form for millennia in the area between China and Europe. These were short weapons-one was 119 cm long when strung, with arrows perhaps 5060 cm long-with working tips. Composite bows were soon adopted and adapted by civilizations, such as the Chinese, Assyrian, Indian, and Egyptian, who came into contact with nomads. Several composite bows were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, who died in 1324 BCE. Composite bows are known in China from at least the Shang Dynasty(1700-1100 BCE). The military of the Han Dynasty (220 BCE-206 CE) utilized composite crossbows, often in infantry square formations, in their many engagements against the Xiongnu. Horse archers such as the Scythians, Parthians, Huns, Bulgars, Seljuk Turks, and Mongols often used skirmishing tactics where they would approach, shoot, and retreat. The term Parthian shot refers to the widespread horse-archer tactic of shooting backwards over the rear of their horses as they retreated. Central Asian nomads such as Scythians, Sakas, and Sarmatians were skilled horse archers. Parthians, originally a Scythian tribe, were famed horse archers. Parthians inflicted several devastating defeats on Romans, the first being the Battle of Carrhae. However, horse archers were not invincible; Han General Ban Chao led successful military expeditions against these nomads in the late 1st century CE that conquered as far as central Asia, and Alexander the Great may be the only general who inflicted a defeat on horse archer armies on his first contact with them.</English>

		<German>Als Kompositbogen (von lat.: compositio, Zusammenstellung, Zusammensetzung) werden alle Jagd- oder Sportbogen bezeichnet, die aus mehreren (mindestens zwei) verschiedenartigen Materialien zusammengesetzt sind, womit Wirkungsgrad und Lebensdauer des Bogens erh&#246;ht werden. Auf den meist aus Holz bestehenden Kern werden dazu andere Materialien aufgeleimt, wie zum Beispiel Horn, Knochen, Metall, Sehnen oder zugstabile andere H&#246;lzer. Der &#228;lteste arch&#228;ologische Beleg der Kompositbauweise (als Bodenfund) stammt aus dem Endneolithikum aus der Region Pribaikalja in der N&#228;he des Baikalsees (Geweihb&#246;gen). Von dort aus soll sich die damals neue Bogenart ins bronzezeitliche Vorderasien und Europa ausgebreitet haben, wo die Weiterentwicklung des Kompositbogens dann jeweils getrennt voneinander vonstatten ging. Die Naram-Sin-Stele (um 2200 v. Chr.) zeigt den K&#246;nig von Akkad mit einem kurzen Reflexbogen, f&#252;r den eine Kompositbauweise naheliegend ist. In der Folgezeit entstanden typisch westliche (z. B. Perser- und Assyrerb&#246;gen) und typisch asiatisch-&#246;stliche Formen (Chinesen- und Yumib&#246;gen etc.), wobei die &#220;berg&#228;nge zwischen ost-asiatischer und west-asiatischer Bauweise recht flie&#223;end waren (z. B. Moghul- und Skythenb&#246;gen). Nach dem Aufkommen der Armbrust in Europa und China im Altertum wurde mit der Erfindung der Armbrustgesch&#252;tze auch der Grundstein f&#252;r die Artillerie gelegt. Nach Afrika kam der Kompositbogen in der Antike zuerst durch die alten &#196;gypter, welche ihn am Beginn der Eisenzeit von ihren damaligen Feinden, den Assyrern, kopiert und dann selbst&#228;ndig weiterentwickelt hatten, im Fr&#252;hmittelalter &#252;bernahmen ihn islamisierte afrikanische V&#246;lker wie die Mauren und die (nun islamischen) &#196;gypter sowie Araber (Sarazenen), jetzt aber in typisch asiatischer (kipchakisch/persischer) Bauart und nicht mehr in assyrischer Bauart wobei ausl&#228;ndische S&#246;ldnerarmeen aus Zentralasien (Mamelucken) vermutlich die Bauweise beeinflussten.</German>

		<Spanish>Un arco compuesto es un tipo de arco utilizado desde la m&#225;s remota Antig&#252;edad. Se le llama compuesto porque contrariamente a los arcos monol&#237;ticos (fabricados en un s&#243;lo cuerpo de madera) su cuerpo, palas y empu&#241;adura, est&#225; compuesto por una sucesi&#243;n de l&#225;minas de diferentes materiales. Tradicionalmente estas l&#225;minas eran, encoladas alternativamente unas sobre las otras, de hueso, madera, tendones o asta, aunque hoy en d&#237;a se utilizan otros materiales, como una alternancia de madera y fibra de carbono o de vidrio. En los arcos de la Antig&#252;edad el m&#233;todo m&#225;s habitual de fabricaci&#243;n consist&#237;a en encolar una l&#225;mina de asta en el interior del arco, frente al arquero, y una de tend&#243;n en el exterior, ambas encerrando una l&#225;mina central de madera.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El arco compuesto fue perfeccionado interminablemente desde sus or&#237;genes en el segundo milenio antes de Cristo hasta el siglo XVII por pueblos asi&#225;ticos y del Medio Oriente. Ten&#237;a mucha m&#225;s potencia que cualquier arco monol&#237;tico y era m&#225;s ligero, pero tambi&#233;n bastante m&#225;s costoso y fr&#225;gil. A finales del Paleol&#237;tico se empleaba el arco sencillo o arco monol&#237;tico, por estar constituido de una &#250;nica pieza de madera. Con el curso del tiempo los arcos monol&#237;ticos se fueron desarrollando de forma cada vez m&#225;s eficaz, como el arco largo ingl&#233;s, pero el arco compuesto est&#225; un escal&#243;n por encima en cuanto a complejidad: su cuerpo no est&#225; hecho de una sola pieza, sino de varios materiales que, combinando sus propiedades mec&#225;nicas, aseguran una potencia y alcance mucho mayores que las del arco monol&#237;tico.</Spanish>

		<English>Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding information. The history of cryptography begins thousands of years ago. The earliest known use of cryptography is found in non-standard hieroglyphs carved into monuments from the Old Kingdom of Egypt circa 1900 BC. These are not thought to be serious attempts at secret communications, however, but rather to have been attempts at mystery, intrigue, or even amusement for literate onlookers. These are examples of still other uses of cryptography, or of something that looks (impressively if misleadingly) like it. Some clay tablets from Mesopotamia somewhat later are clearly meant to protect informationone dated near 1500 BC was found to encrypt a craftsmans recipe for pottery glaze, presumably commercially valuable. Later still, Hebrew scholars made use of simple monoalphabetic substitution ciphers (such as the Atbash cipher) beginning perhaps around 500 to 600 BC. The ancient Greeks are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). Herodotus tells us of secret messages physically concealed beneath wax on wooden tablets or as a tattoo on a slaves head concealed by regrown hair, though these are not properly examples of cryptography per se as the message, once known, is directly readable; this is known as steganography. Another Greek method was developed by Polybius (now called the "Polybius Square"). The Romans knew something of cryptography (e.g., the Caesar cipher and its variations).</English>

		<German>Die Kryptographie war urspr&#252;nglich die Wissenschaft der Verschl&#252;sselung von Informationen. Der fr&#252;heste Einsatz von Kryptographie findet sich im dritten Jahrtausend v. Chr. in der alt&#228;gyptischen Kryptographie des Alten Reiches. Eine Variante war, dass man den Sklaven die Sch&#228;del kahlrasierte, ihnen die Geheimbotschaft auf den Kopf t&#228;towierte und, nachdem das Haar nachgewachsen war, zum Empf&#228;nger schickte. Eine weitere Variante war, dass man Nachrichten in Holzplatten schrieb und anschliessend die Holzplatten mit Wachs &#252;berzog. Diese Art der Nachrichtenversendung arbeitete noch ohne Verschl&#252;sselung der Daten. Die Daten wurden einfach nicht erkennbar verschickt. Ver&#228;nderungen von Texten fand man aber bereits in alt-testamentarischen Schriften. In den B&#252;chern Jeremiah wurde das Wort Babel an mehreren Stellen durch den Ausdruck Sheshech ersetzt, welcher sich aus einer speziellen Substitution namens Atbash ergibt. Im Atbash werden der erste und der letzte Buchstabe des Alphabets, usw., vertauscht. Aus der Zeit um 475 v. Chr. ist das erste milit&#228;risch genutzte System bekannt. Dabei wurden die Nachrichten auf einen Papyrusstreifen geschrieben, welcher um einen Holzstab mit einem bestimmten Durchmesser gerollt wurde. Diese Nachricht bestand anschliessend aus einer Reihe von Buchstaben, welche erst einen Sinn ergaben, wenn der Empf&#228;nger den Papyrusstreifen um einen Holzstab mit demselben Durchmesser wickelte. Julius C&#228;sar benutzte w&#228;hrend seiner Regentschaft ein einfaches Substitutionsverfahren.

		<Spanish>Criptograf&#237;a (del griego krypto, oculto, y graphos, escribir, literalmente escritura oculta) tradicionalmente se ha definido como la parte de la criptolog&#237;a que se ocupa de las t&#233;cnicas, bien sea aplicadas al arte o la ciencia, que alteran las representaciones ling&#252;&#237;sticas de mensajes, mediante t&#233;cnicas de cifrado y/o codificado, para hacerlos ininteligibles a intrusos (lectores no autorizados) que intercepten esos mensajes. Por tanto el &#250;nico objetivo de la criptograf&#237;a era conseguir la confidencialidad de los mensajes. Para ello se dise&#241;aban sistemas de cifrado y c&#243;digos. En esos tiempos la &#250;nica criptograf&#237;a que hab&#237;a era la llamada criptograf&#237;a cl&#225;sica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El uso m&#225;s antiguo conocido de la criptograf&#237;a se halla en jerogl&#237;ficos no est&#225;ndares tallados en monumentos del Antiguo Egipto (hace m&#225;s de 4500 a&#241;os). Sin embargo, no se piensa que sean intentos serios de comunicaci&#243;n secreta, sino intentos de conseguir misterio, intriga o incluso diversi&#243;n para el espectador letrado. Son ejemplos de otros usos de la criptograf&#237;a, o de algo que se le parece. M&#225;s tarde, eruditos hebreos hicieron uso de sencillos cifrados por sustituci&#243;n monoalfab&#233;ticos (como el cifrado Atbash), quiz&#225;s desde el 600 al 500 a. C. La criptograf&#237;a tiene una larga tradici&#243;n en las escrituras religiosas que podr&#237;an ofender a la cultura dominante o a las autoridades pol&#237;ticas. Quiz&#225;s el caso m&#225;s famoso es el 'N&#250;mero de la bestia', del libro del Apocalipsis en el Nuevo Testamento cristiano. El '666' puede ser una forma criptogr&#225;fica (es decir, cifrada) de ocultar una referencia peligrosa; muchos expertos creen que es una referencia oculta al Imperio romano, o m&#225;s probablemente al propio emperador Ner&#243;n (y as&#237; a las pol&#237;ticas persecutorias romanas), que ser&#237;a entendida por los iniciados (los que 'ten&#237;an la clave del entendimiento'), y sin embargo ser&#237;a segura o al menos negable (y por tanto 'menos' peligrosa) si atra&#237;a la atenci&#243;n de las autoridades. Al menos para las escrituras ortodoxas cristianas, casi toda esta necesidad de ocultaci&#243;n desapareci&#243; con la conversi&#243;n y adopci&#243;n del cristianismo como religi&#243;n oficial del Imperio por parte del emperador Constantino.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se dice que los griegos de la &#233;poca cl&#225;sica conoc&#237;an el cifrado (por ejemplo, se dice que los militares espartanos utilizaban el cifrado por transposici&#243;n de la esc&#237;tala). Her&#243;doto nos habla de mensajes secretos ocultos f&#237;sicamente detr&#225;s de la cera en tablas de madera, o como tatuajes en la cabeza de un esclavo, bajo el cabello, aunque esto no son ejemplos verdaderos de criptograf&#237;a, ya que el mensaje, una vez conocido, es legible directamente; esto se conoce como esteganograf&#237;a. Los romanos s&#237; sab&#237;an algo de criptograf&#237;a con toda seguridad (por ejemplo, el cifrado C&#233;sar y sus variaciones). Hay una menci&#243;n antigua a un libro sobre criptograf&#237;a militar romana (especialmente la de Julio C&#233;sar); desafortunadamente, se ha perdido.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En India tambi&#233;n se conoc&#237;a la criptograf&#237;a. El Kama Sutra la recomienda como t&#233;cnica para que los amantes se comuniquen sin ser descubiertos.</Spanish>

		<English>Armor is protective covering used to prevent damage from being inflicted to an object, individual or a vehicle through use of direct contact weapons or projectiles. Armor is used to protect soldiers, and war animals such as war horses during combat. Armor has been used throughout recorded history. It has been made from a variety of materials; from rudimentary leather protection, personal armor evolved to mail and full plated suits of armor. For much of military history the manufacture of metal armor in Europe has dominated the technology and employment of armor. Armor drove the development of many important technologies of the Ancient World, including wood lamination, mining, metal refining, vehicle manufacture, leather processing, and later decorative metal working. Its production was influential in the industrial revolution, and influenced commercial development of metallurgy and engineering. In history, the use of armor was often not more than a helmet and leg plates. The rest of the body was generally protected by means of a (large) shield. Cuirasses were thus not used. Examples of armies equipping their troops in this fashion were the hoplites in Ancient Greece.</English>

		<German>Als R&#252;stung bezeichnet man eine Schutzbekleidung, die ihren Tr&#228;ger in erster Linie vor Waffeneinwirkung und gegen Verwundung sch&#252;tzen soll. R&#252;stungen sind bereits seit Jahrtausenden gebr&#228;uchlich und wurden aus den unterschiedlichsten Materialien und nach verschiedenen Methoden hergestellt. &#196;lteste Formen der R&#252;stungen sind bei fr&#252;hen indigenen V&#246;lkern zu finden. Alle Anf&#228;nge der R&#252;stungen greifen auf nat&#252;rliche Produkte zur&#252;ck. Man benutzte Baumrinde, das Fell oder Knochen und Hornteile der erlegten Jagdbeute. Die Weiterentwickelung der R&#252;stung zielte auf die Erh&#246;hung der Festigkeit, gepaart mit gr&#246;&#223;erer Bewegungsfreiheit. Das erreichte man durch Vervielf&#228;ltigung der Einzellagen des Materials, durch Verst&#228;rkung mittels aufgelegter Horn-, Holz- oder Metallplatten, durch eine beweglichere Neben- und &#220;bereinanderlagerung der Schuppen sowie Panzer aus Riemen- und Schnurgeflecht, aus Einzelst&#228;bchen u.s.w. abschlie&#223;end wurde Metall verwendet. Assyrische und chald&#228;ische Soldaten trugen bereits 710 v. Chr. einen hemdartigen Panzer, dessen Metallschuppen auf B&#252;ffelhaut gen&#228;ht waren. Bei den Leichtbewaffneten reichte der Schutz bis zur H&#252;fte. Bei den schwerbewaffneten Soldaten bedeckte er Hals und Oberarm und reichte bis zu den F&#252;&#223;en. In der Kofun-Zeit entwickelten die Japaner die Tanko-R&#252;stungen. Diese R&#252;stungen bestanden aus Eisenblech und gegerbtem Leder. In &#196;gypten kommen neben Lederr&#252;stungen, die oft mit breiten Metallb&#228;ndern (Brustschienen) verst&#228;rkt waren, Panzerhemden aus Bronzeschuppen von 2025 cm Gr&#246;&#223;e sowie Arm- und Beinschienen aus Bronze schon um 1000 v. Chr. vor. Solche Schuppenpanzer waren auch bei Parthern, Persern und Sarmaten gebr&#228;uchlich und verbreiteten sich von ihnen &#252;ber den ganzen Orient. Die Griechen trugen um diese Zeit schon bronzene Brust- und R&#252;ckenpanzer, je aus einem St&#252;ck geschmiedet oder aus dachziegelf&#246;rmigen Schiebeplatten bestehend, sowie Beinschienen (Knemiden) an beiden Beinen, gleich den Etruskern. Bei den R&#246;mern trugen die Veliten (leichtbewaffnete Infanterie) am linken, die Schwerbewaffneten am rechten, dem beim Kampf vorgesetzten Bein, die Beinschienen (ocreae). Der Schuppenpanzer (lorica) bestand aus Schuppen von Metall, Knochen oder Horn, nach Form der Fisch- (rund) oder Schlangenschuppen oder der Vogelfedern, die auf Leder oder Leinwand mit Lederriemen oder Draht befestigt waren, und bedeckte au&#223;er Brust und R&#252;cken auch Bauch, H&#252;ften und Schultern. Die schwerbewaffneten Reiter, die in fr&#252;hester Zeit den Kern des Heeres bildeten, waren bis zu den F&#252;&#223;en und H&#228;nden mit einem Schuppenpanzer bekleidet. Zur Zeit der Republik trugen die Hastati bereits armlose, nur bis zur H&#252;fte reichende Kettenpanzer; um das Jahr 160 v. Chr. hatten die Principes Ringpanzer, die Hastati und Triarii dagegen eherne Brustplatten von m&#228;&#223;iger Gr&#246;&#223;e. Den Germanen kam im 4. Jahrh. wahrscheinlich vom Osten die Sitte, den K&#246;rper mit hieb- und stichsichern Kleidern zu bedecken.</German>

		<Spanish>La armadura es una vestidura compuesta por piezas met&#225;licas o de otro material resistente (en muchos casos el cuero) que se utilizaba para proteger el cuerpo del combatiente.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El origen de la armadura data del periodo egipcio, en el que la vestidura militar consist&#237;a en un casco y una coraza de tela fuerte o de cuero cubiertos en gran parte con placas met&#225;licas. Entre los caldeos-asirios, a tenor de lo que aparece en los relieves de la &#233;poca, se usaba un casco de bronce de forma algo c&#243;nica, una coraza hecha de piel cubierta de l&#225;minas met&#225;licas y unos botines de cuero duro o guarnecidos tambi&#233;n con l&#225;minas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los soldados griegos sol&#237;an llevar una t&#250;nica corta que terminaba en pliegues sim&#233;tricos y sobre ella una coraza para el tronco, formada por tiras de cuero con piezas met&#225;licas o bien s&#243;lo dos piezas (peto y espaldar) que cubr&#237;an pecho y espalda y se un&#237;an con tiras met&#225;licas o correas sobre los hombros, mientras que la parte delantera de las piernas se defend&#237;a con las cn&#233;mides o canilleras.

		<English>The Bible tells us that camels were used as pack animals already in the days of Abraham. The pharaoh of Egypt gave Abraham camels, among other presents, for the sake of Sarah, whom he wanted to marry (Genesis 12:16). Later, when Abrahams servant Eliezer was sent to northern Mesopotamia to find a wife for Isaac, the pack animals he made use of were camels (Gen.24:10,32,63). Learned Biblical critics have repeatedly stressed that domesticated camels did not exist so early in history and that they figure in the book of Genesis as anachronisms added later to the text, or even provide proof that the stories are unreliable. Domesticating camels in order to use them as pack animals did not come into use till about 1100 B.C., they say. Some scholars arrived at this conclusion because they had not seen any older texts relating to domesticated camels. Assyrian texts dating from the 11th century B.C. are the first to report about pack camels. W.F. Albright, the once famous Biblical archaeologist, was among those who shared the opinion that the statements about camels in Genesis were anachronisms. In his view, camels were not employed on international trade routes much earlier than the 12th century B.C. The oldest pieces of evidence about dromedaries being domesticated have been found in Umm an-Nar, a city on an island in the Persian Gulf off the coast of Oman. Here 200 bones and teeth of camels have been excavated together with objects dating back to about 2700 B.C.5 Notwithstanding this, most archaeologists hold on to their view that dromedaries were not used in international trade caravans until the 12th century B.C. The earliest evidence that Bactrian camels were domesticated originates from Shahr-i-Sokhta in the east of Iran. A jar filled with camels dung and fragments of camels hair, dating back to about 2500 B.C., has been discovered here. In 1977 archaeologist Edith Porada carried out a study of a cylindrical seal found in Syria; it shows two small figures riding on a two-humped animal, obviously a camel. The seal dates back to the 18th century B.C. The small figures most probably depict a god and a goddes. This could point to the use of domesticated camels in that period; however it could also mean that the camel was known as a wild animal on which only gods were able to ride. Collan and Porada anyhow concluded that Bactrian camels were used as pack animals in international trade earlier than what is generally believed. At the beginning of the 20th century a statuette of a dromedary carrying two water jars was found in a tomb at Rifeh. The tomb was in use during the 19th dynasty, which reigned in the 13th century B.C., and was not used again in later times. The water jars were of the type used during that century. Another piece of evidence that dromedaries were used as pack animals in Egypt as early as 1300 B.C. was a glaze picture of a dromedary with water jars found in Benha. Definite proof that dromedaries were already domesticated in early times was given in 1912. Near Aswan a rock painting was discovered which showed a man pulling along a dromedary on a rope, plus seven hieroglyphic characters. On account of the writing G. M&#246;ller dated the inscription to the period of the sixth dynasty (2320-2150 B.C.), and G. Schweinfurth concluded to the same period for the painting on account of its style. This find, which has not become widely known, presents conclusive evidence that Egypt had domesticated dromedaries as early as 2200 B.C. or even earlier, anyway long before the days of Abraham. The allegation of certain scholars that statements about camels in the book of Genesis are anachronisms only exposes their lack of knowledge.</English>

		<German>Die Eigenschaften der Kamele sind nat&#252;rlich auch f&#252;r die Menschen der W&#252;stenregionen von Vorteil, und so verwundert es nicht, dass beide Altweltkamelarten bereits im dritten vorchristlichen Jahrtausend (vor &#252;ber 5.500 Jahren) domestiziert wurden und der Mensch sie seitdem als Haustiere nutzt. In den Emiraten reicht die Nutzung von Kamelen nachweislich bis 2600 v. Chr. zur&#252;ck. Das asiatische Trampeltier, das an das etwas feuchtere und leicht k&#252;hlere Wetter der asiatischen Steppe angepasst ist, erfolgte etwa zur selben Zeit. Kamele scheinen urspr&#252;nglich haupts&#228;chlich als Milchlieferant domestiziert worden zu sein. In Somalia &#252;berwiegt diese Nutzung bis heute. Die Nutzung als Fleisch- und Lederquelle sowie eine Verwendung der Wolle entwickelten sich etwas sp&#228;ter. Sogar ihr Mist dient, getrocknet, in der rohstoffarmen Umgebung als Brennmaterial. Bis etwa 1500 v. Chr. wurde fast ausschlie&#223;lich der Esel als Transporttier im Verbreitungsgebiet der Kamele genutzt. Die Nutzung des Kamels als Lasttier setzte zun&#228;chst die Entwicklung eines geeigneten Sattels voraus. Dieser musste die Last auch bei den wiegenden Bewegung des Kamels halten und gleichm&#228;&#223;ig auf dem R&#252;cken des Kamels verteilen. Zwischen 1300 und 100 v. Chr. entwickelten nomadisch lebende arabische Ethnien einen f&#252;r das Kamel angepassten Tragesattel, der es erlaubte, durchschnittlich etwa 250 Kilogramm auf einem Kamelr&#252;cken zu transportieren. Diese Sattelform ist seit mehr als 2.000 Jahren nahezu unver&#228;ndert in Gebrauch. In Asien erlangte das Trampeltier nicht die Bedeutung, die das Dromedar im arabischen Raum gewann. Auf den zentralasiatischen Hochplateaus dominierte das Yak, Schafe, die Milch und Wolle lieferten, sowie Hausrinder und Wasserb&#252;ffel konnten im gr&#246;&#223;ten Teil des asiatischen Raums gehalten werden. Dromedare dagegen wurden in einem immer gr&#246;&#223;er werdenden Gebiet genutzt. In Syrien, Iraq, Iran und sp&#228;ter Indien fand das Dromedar immer mehr Verwendung.</German>

		<Spanish>El camello bactriano, camello asi&#225;tico o simplemente camello (Camelus bactrianus, llamado a veces Camelus ferus bactrianus) es una especie de mam&#237;fero artiod&#225;ctilo de la familia Camelidae, una de las dos especies de la familia que se pueden encontrar actualmente en el Viejo Mundo. Est&#225; muy emparentado con la otra, el camello ar&#225;bigo o dromedario (Camelus dromedarius).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El camello bactriano recibe su nombre del &#225;rea de la que se supone es originario: Bactriana, nombre con el que los griegos conoc&#237;an a la regi&#243;n situada entre la cordillera del Hindu Kush y el r&#237;o Amu Daria, y donde debi&#243; ser domesticado hacia el 2500 a. C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se trata de una especie m&#225;s robusta y de extremidades un poco m&#225;s cortas que el dromedario, con dos gibas en lugar de una sola como su pariente. El pelo var&#237;a enormemente en su longitud y coloraci&#243;n (sobre todo en los individuos dom&#233;sticos), aunque en los salvajes tiende a ser fino, largo, espeso y lanoso, especialmente en cuello, jorobas y patas anteriores. El color es pardo oscuro llegando a casi negro en algunas zonas. Esto le permite defenderse tanto del sol implacable de las estepas y desiertos rocosos de Asia central como de las bajas temperaturas. El tama&#241;o puede ser de hasta 1,80 metros en la cruz y tres de largo, con un peso de 600 a 1000 kilos. Las hembras son un poco m&#225;s peque&#241;as y ligeras que los machos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Este animal tolera condiciones clim&#225;ticas verdaderamente extremas, especialmente en el T&#237;bet y otras &#225;reas monta&#241;osas de Asia central, donde las temperaturas de verano pueden llegar a los 60 &#186;C, mientras que las de invierno son muy inferiores a los 0 &#186;C. Su capacidad para resistir largos periodos de tiempo sin comer ni beber, gracias a la grasa almacenada en las jorobas, y su gran fortaleza f&#237;sica (puede caminar 47 kil&#243;metros al d&#237;a con cargas de casi 450 kilos) lo han hecho un animal dom&#233;stico de gran importancia en las zonas donde habita, desde Mongolia a Ir&#225;n. Tambi&#233;n se aprovechan su carne, leche y pieles.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El camello salvaje est&#225; considerado una especie en peligro de extinci&#243;n. S&#243;lo se encuentra libre en unas pocas &#225;reas des&#233;rticas del sur de Mongolia y la regi&#243;n china de Xinjiang, por donde vaga en peque&#241;os grupos familiares de entre 6 y 30 individuos, en el caso de las hembras y sus cr&#237;as (una o dos cada vez), o de forma solitaria en el caso de los machos. Se alimentan de hierbas y ra&#237;ces, y carecen de depredadores; sus &#250;nicos problemas los causan la ocupaci&#243;n de sus territorios por los pastores para que pasten los animales dom&#233;sticos.[NEWLINE]</Spanish>

		<English>A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets. Ancient people learned about magnetism from lodestones, naturally magnetized pieces of iron ore. They are naturally created magnets, which attract pieces of iron. The word magnet in Greek meant "stone from Magnesia", a part of ancient Greece where lodestones were found. Lodestones suspended so they could turn were the first magnetic compasses. The earliest known surviving descriptions of magnets and their properties are from Greece, India, and China around 2500 years ago. The properties of lodestones and their affinity for iron were written of by Pliny the Elder in his encyclopedia Naturalis Historia.</English>

		<Italian>A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets. Ancient people learned about magnetism from lodestones, naturally magnetized pieces of iron ore. They are naturally created magnets, which attract pieces of iron. The word magnet in Greek meant "stone from Magnesia", a part of ancient Greece where lodestones were found. Lodestones suspended so they could turn were the first magnetic compasses. The earliest known surviving descriptions of magnets and their properties are from Greece, India, and China around 2500 years ago. The properties of lodestones and their affinity for iron were written of by Pliny the Elder in his encyclopedia Naturalis Historia.</Italian>

		<German>Eine Bireme ist ein antikes Ruderkriegsschiff mit zwei Reihen von Riemen &#252;bereinander. Zweireihige Ruderschiffe waren, wie ein Relief aus Ninive zeigt, um 700 v. Chr. bereits bei den Ph&#246;niziern im Einsatz. Wie andere antike Kriegsschiffe, so die bekannten Trieren, trugen Biremen am Bug, knapp &#252;ber der Wasserlinie, einen Rammsporn, der zum Rammen gegnerischer Schiffe eingesetzt wurde. Ab der Mitte des 8. Jh. v. Chr. gab es die aphrakt gebauten zweireihige und zweirangige Trikontere mit ca. 15 m L&#228;nge sowie die zweireihige und zweirangige Pentekontere mit einer L&#228;nge von ca. 20m. Die bauliche Umsetzung der f&#252;r den Einsatz der Rammtaktik erforderlichen h&#246;heren Geschwindigkeit f&#252;hrte zu dieser zweireihigen Version der Konteren. Dies wurde zun&#228;chst &#252;ber ein durch Deckst&#252;tzen getragenes, erh&#246;htes Deck erreicht. W&#228;hrend die untere Ruderreihe weiterhin ihre Ruder auf Dollbordh&#246;he einsetzten, konnte die obere Reihe Ruder nur von Oberdeck bedient werden. Im Gefecht konnten diese Ruder jedoch nicht genutzt werden, da das Oberdeck gleichzeitig Kampfdeck war. Tats&#228;chlich waren diese Schiffe daher nur bei Verlegungsm&#228;rschen zweireihige Schiffe, da im Gefecht f&#252;r den Vortrieb nur der monerische Antrieb, also die untere Ruderreihe, genutzt werden konnte. Mit dieser Ruderanordnung konnte jedoch keine h&#246;here Geschwindigkeit f&#252;r den Rammsto&#223; erzielt werden. Schiffbaulich ergab dieser &#220;berbau eine extreme Kopflastigkeit. Damit war zwar eine Ruderanordnung nach Art der Bireme erreicht, jedoch musste die schiffbauliche Entwicklung auf dem Weg zur echten Bireme weiter fortschreiten. Assyrische BiremeAssyrische Reliefs aus der Zeit des Sanherib (704-681 BC) zeigen ein ph&#246;nizisches zweireihiges Schiff. W&#228;hrend die obere Ruderreihe sich weiterhin auf Dollbordh&#246;he befand, wurden die Ruder der unteren Reihe durch &#214;ffnungen im Schiffsrumpf bedient. Somit konnten auch im Gefecht beide Reihen Ruderer eingesetzt werden und die f&#252;r einen erfolgreichen Rammsto&#223; notwendige Geschwindigkeit erreicht werden. Das auch hier vorhandene Kampfdeck ruhte auf Deckst&#252;tzen, die auf dem Dollbord aufsa&#223;en. Die Ruderer der oberen Reihe wurden durch seitlich angebrachte Schilde gesch&#252;tzt. F&#252;r Transportaufgaben wurde wahrscheinlich nur eine Ruderbank bemannt. Der Schiffstyp der Bireme trat zuerst im sp&#228;ten 8. Jh. v. Chr. und hatte sich um 700 v. Chr. bei allen griechischen und Nahost Marinen durchgesetzt.</German>

		<Spanish>Hacia el siglo VIII a. C. el dise&#241;o de las antiguas galeras fue modificado. Constructores de buques, probablemente fenicios, superpusieron una segunda hilera de remos, creando el barco com&#250;nmente conocido por su nombre griego: bi&#275;r&#275;s, birreme.

Expone este autor que la pretensi&#243;n de que los dieres griegos del siglo VI a.

La separaci&#243;n vertical entre los toletes de los remos de los birremes de Quyundjiq es m&#237;nima. En Grecia, hasta el siglo VI a. C. no se incorpor&#243; esta caracter&#237;stica. Esta disposici&#243;n implicaba que los remeros estaban dispuestos en dos niveles, y el casco, en consecuencia, ten&#237;a el centro de gravedad bajo. A partir de entonces se dot&#243; al birreme de un puente que se extend&#237;a por toda la cubierta. Estaba protegido todo el per&#237;metro del alc&#225;zar este barco asirio, por un pav&#233;s del que estaban suspendidos muchos escudos, que proteg&#237;an a los soldados en cubierta. La comparaci&#243;n ente el birreme representado en una cr&#225;tera &#225;tica conservada en el Museo Real de Ontario (Toronto) y el de Quyundjiq, en opini&#243;n de Basch, demuestra que estas naves ten&#237;an una estructura totalmente diferente: la segunda tiene m&#225;s manga que la primera</Spanish>

		<English>Democracy is a form of government in which all citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Ideally, this includes equal (and more or less direct) participation in the proposal, development and passage of legislation into law. It can also encompass social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. According to some theories of democracy, popular sovereignty is the founding principle of such a system. However, the democratic principle has also been expressed as "the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known." This type of freedom, which is connected to human "natality," or the capacity to begin anew, sees democracy as "not only a political system [but] an ideal, an aspiration, really, intimately connected to and dependent upon a picture of what it is to be humanof what it is a human should be to be fully human." While there is no specific, universally accepted definition of democracy, equality and freedom have both been identified as important characteristics of democracy since ancient times. These principles are reflected in all citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative, and the freedom of its citizens is secured by legitimized rights and liberties which are generally protected by a constitution. There are several varieties of democracy, some of which provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others. However, if any democracy is not structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its own favor, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy. Representative Democracy, Consensus Democracy, and Deliberative Democracy are all major examples of attempts at a form of government that is both practical and responsive to the needs and desires of citizens. Many people use the term "democracy" as shorthand for liberal democracy, which may include elements such as political pluralism; equality before the law; the right to petition elected officials for redress of grievances; due process; civil liberties; human rights; and elements of civil society outside the government. In the United States, separation of powers is often cited as a central attribute, but in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty (though in practice judicial independence is generally maintained). In other cases, "democracy" is used to mean direct democracy. Though the term "democracy" is typically used in the context of a political state, the principles are applicable to private organizations and other groups as well. Majority rule is often listed as a characteristic of democracy. However, it is also possible for a minority to be oppressed by a "tyranny of the majority" in the absence of governmental or constitutional protections of individual and/or group rights. An essential part of an "ideal" representative democracy is competitive elections that are fair both substantively and procedurally. Furthermore, freedom of political expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press are considered to be essential, so that citizens are adequately informed and able to vote according to their own best interests as they see them. It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of individuals to participate freely and fully in the life of their society. The term democracy first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought. The philosopher Plato contrasted democracy, the system of "rule by the governed", with the alternative systems of monarchy (rule by one individual), oligarchy (rule by a small lite class) and timocracy (ruling class of property owners). Today Classical Athenian democracy is considered by many to have been a direct democracy. Originally it had two distinguishing features: first the allotment (selection by lot) of ordinary citizens to the few government offices and the courts, and secondarily the assembly of all the citizens. All citizens were eligible to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city-state. However, Athenian citizens were all-male, born from parents who were born in Athens, and excluded women, slaves, foreigners and males under 20 years old. Of the perhaps 250,000 inhabitants only a small plurality were citizens. The (elected) generals often held influence in the assembly. Pericles was, during his many years of de-facto political leadership, once elected general 15 years in a row. A possible example of primitive democracy may have been the early Sumerian city-states.A similar proto-democracy or oligarchy existed temporarily among the Medes (ancient Iranian people) in the 6th century BC, but which came to an end after the Achaemenid (Persian) Emperor Darius the Great declared that the best monarchy was better than the best oligarchy or best democracy. Although the term "democracy" is not often used for civilizations outside of Europe in ancient times there were organizations of government very akin to democracy in some African societies such as the Igbo nation of what is now Nigeria. A serious claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent "republics" of India, sanghas and ganas, which existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century AD. The evidence is scattered and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, Diodorus (a Greek historian at the time of Alexander the Greats excursion of India), without offering any detail, mentions that independent and democratic states existed in India. However, modern scholars note that the word democracy at the 3rd century BC and later had been degraded and could mean any autonomous state no matter how oligarchic it was. The lack of the concept of citizen equality across caste system boundaries has led many scholars to believe that the true nature of ganas and sanghas would not be comparable to that of truly democratic institutions. Even though the Roman Republic contributed significantly to certain aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of Gerrymandering, so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. However, many notable exceptions did occur.</English>

		<German>Die Demokratie bezeichnet einerseits das Ideal einer durch die Zustimmung der Mehrheit der B&#252;rger und die Beteiligung der B&#252;rger legitimierten Regierungsform, der Volksherrschaft. Die Geschichte der Demokratie ist eng verkn&#252;pft mit der Entwicklung der Idee des Naturrechts, die wiederum eng verwandt ist mit dem Begriff der Menschenrechte. Ausgehend von den Naturrechten wurde die Idee der Gleichberechtigung der Freien entwickelt, die sich in den fr&#252;hen Ans&#228;tzen demokratischer Gesellschaften wiederfindet. Die Mitgestaltungsbefugnisse eines Menschen hingen zun&#228;chst vom Status der Person ab: Nur freie B&#252;rger hatten diese Rechte inne was Sklaven, Frauen und Nicht-B&#252;rger (z.B. Ausl&#228;nder) ausschloss. Als erste Verwirklichung einer Demokratie in der Geschichte wird die antike Attische Demokratie angesehen, die nach heftigem Ringen des Adels und der Reichen mit dem einfachen Volk errichtet wurde und allen m&#228;nnlichen Vollb&#252;rgern der Stadt Athen Mitbestimmung in der Regierung gew&#228;hrte, wenn man &#252;ber 20 Jahre alt war. Die Anzahl der Vollb&#252;rger betrug etwa 30.000 bis 40.000 M&#228;nner. Bei wichtigen Entscheidungen, z. B. &#252;ber Krieg und Frieden, mussten mindestens 6.000 anwesend sein. Beamte (z. B. die Archonten) wurden urspr&#252;nglich durch das Los bestimmt abgesehen von den Strategen, welche f&#252;r die Armee zust&#228;ndig waren und im Krieg eine gro&#223;e Rolle spielten. Aufgrund der Unzufriedenheit breiter Bev&#246;lkerungsschichten im griechischen Mutterland in sp&#228;tarchaischer Zeit (7. und 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr.) und des Vorhandenseins unabh&#228;ngigen und &#246;ffentlichen politischen Denkens, kam es zuerst zur Vorstufe der Demokratie, der Isonomie. Nicht zuletzt aufgrund der Erfolge der freien griechischen Poleis w&#228;hrend der Perserkriege wurde diese Entwicklung beschleunigt und fand ihren Endpunkt in der attischen Demokratie, in der die B&#252;rger in Athen die M&#246;glichkeit bekamen, in einer auf breiteren Schichten basierenden politischen Ordnung mitzuwirken. Auch die R&#246;mische Republik verwirklichte bis zur schrittweisen, kontinuierlichen Abl&#246;sung durch den Prinzipat eine Gesellschaft mit rudiment&#228;ren demokratischen Elementen, basierend auf der Idee der Gleichberechtigung der Freien bei der Wahl der republikanischen Magistrate, wenn auch das oligarchische Prinzip bestimmend war. Andererseits vertritt der Historiker Fergus Millar einen anderen Standpunkt und interpretiert die R&#246;mische Republik viel mehr als eine Art direkt-demokratisches Staatswesen. Die historisch bedeutendere Leistung Roms d&#252;rfte allerdings die Etablierung einer fr&#252;hen Form eines Rechtsstaats sein, einem Konzept, das ebenfalls eng mit unserem heutigen Demokratieverst&#228;ndnis zusammenh&#228;ngt. Bei Marcus Tullius Cicero wird der Begriff der Demokratie als civitas popularis romanisiert (De re publica, I), womit die sp&#228;trepublikanische Bezeichnung der Parteiung der Popularen zum Namensgeber der entsprechenden Verfassungsform wird. Nach Cicero besticht diese Herrschaftsform durch die Freiheit, welche die B&#252;rger in ihr genie&#223;en, wobei er diese aber auch stets durch die Gefahr der Z&#252;gellosigkeit der Masse bedroht sieht.</German>

		<Spanish>Democracia es una forma de organizaci&#243;n de grupos de personas, cuya caracter&#237;stica predominante es que la titularidad del poder reside en la totalidad de sus miembros, haciendo que la toma de decisiones responda a la voluntad colectiva de los miembros del grupo. En sentido estricto la democracia es una forma de organizaci&#243;n del Estado, en la cual las decisiones colectivas son adoptadas por el pueblo mediante mecanismos de participaci&#243;n directa o indirecta que le confieren legitimidad a los representantes. En sentido amplio, democracia es una forma de convivencia social en la que los miembros son libres e iguales y las relaciones sociales se establecen de acuerdo a mecanismos contractuales. La democracia se define tambi&#233;n a partir de la cl&#225;sica clasificaci&#243;n de las formas de gobierno realizada por Plat&#243;n, primero, y Arist&#243;teles, despu&#233;s, en tres tipos b&#225;sicos: monarqu&#237;a (gobierno de uno), aristocracia (gobierno de los mejores para Plat&#243;n, de los menos, para Arist&#243;teles), democracia (gobierno de la multitud para Plat&#243;n y de los m&#225;s, para Arist&#243;teles). Hay democracia directa cuando la decisi&#243;n es adoptada directamente por los miembros del pueblo. Hay democracia indirecta o representativa cuando la decisi&#243;n es adoptada por personas reconocidas por el pueblo como sus representantes. Por &#250;ltimo, hay democracia participativa cuando se aplica un modelo pol&#237;tico que facilita a los ciudadanos su capacidad de asociarse y organizarse de tal modo que puedan ejercer una influencia directa en las decisiones p&#250;blicas o cuando se facilita a la ciudadan&#237;a amplios mecanismos plebiscitarios. Estas tres formas no son excluyentes y suelen integrarse como mecanismos complementarios. No debe confundirse Rep&#250;blica con Democracia, pues aluden a principios distintos, la rep&#250;blica es el gobierno de la ley mientras que democracia significa el gobierno de la mayor&#237;a.[PARAGRAPH:2] El t&#233;rmino democracia proviene del antiguo griego (??????????) y fue acu&#241;ado en Atenas en el siglo V a. C. a partir de los vocablos demos, que puede traducirse como pueblo y kr&#225;tos, que puede traducirse como poder. Sin embargo la significaci&#243;n etimol&#243;gica del t&#233;rmino es mucho m&#225;s compleja. El t&#233;rmino demos parece haber sido un neologismo derivado de la fusi&#243;n de las palabras demiurgos (demiurgi) y geomoros (geomori). El historiador Plutarco se&#241;alaba que los geomoros y demiurgos, eran junto a los eup&#225;tridas, las tres clases en las que Teseo dividi&#243; a la poblaci&#243;n libre del &#193;tica (adicionalmente la poblaci&#243;n estaba integrada tambi&#233;n por los metecos, esclavos y las mujeres). Los eup&#225;tridas eran los nobles; los demiurgos eran los artesanos; y los geomoros eran los campesinos. Estos dos &#250;ltimos grupos, en creciente oposici&#243;n a la nobleza, formaron el demos. Textualmente entonces, democracia significa gobierno de los artesanos y campesinos, excluyendo del mismo expresamente a los esclavos y a los nobles. Algunos pensadores consideran a la democracia ateniense como el primer ejemplo de un sistema democr&#225;tico. Otros pensadores han criticado esta conclusi&#243;n, argumentando por un lado que tanto en la organizaci&#243;n tribal como en antiguas civilizaciones en todo el mundo existen ejemplos de sistemas pol&#237;ticos democr&#225;ticos, y por otro lado que solo una peque&#241;a minor&#237;a del 10% de la poblaci&#243;n ten&#237;a derecho a participar de la llamada democracia ateniense, quedando autom&#225;ticamente excluidos la mayor&#237;a de trabajadores, campesinos, esclavos y las mujeres. De todas formas, el significado del t&#233;rmino ha cambiado con el tiempo, y la definici&#243;n moderna ha evolucionado mucho, sobre todo desde finales del siglo XVIII, con la sucesiva introducci&#243;n de sistemas democr&#225;ticos en muchas naciones y sobre todo a partir del reconocimiento del sufragio universal y del voto femenino en el siglo XX. Hoy en d&#237;a, las democracias existentes son bastante distintas al sistema de gobierno ateniense del que heredan su nombre.</Spanish>

		<English>Pathology is the study and diagnosis of disease. The word pathology is from Greek pathos, "feeling, suffering"; and -logia, "the study of". Pathologization, to pathologize, refers to the process of defining a condition or behavior as pathological, e.g. pathological gambling. Pathologies is synonymous with diseases. The suffix "path" is used to indicate a disease, e.g. psychopath. Pathology addresses 4 components of disease: cause/etiology, mechanisms of development (pathogenesis), structural alterations of cells (morphologic changes), and the consequences of changes (clinical manifestations). Pathology is further separated into divisions, based on either the system being studied (e.g. veterinary pathology and animal disease) or the focus of the examination (e.g. forensic pathology and determining the cause of death). General pathology, also called investigative pathology, experimental pathology, or theoretical pathology, is a broad and complex scientific field which seeks to understand the mechanisms of injury to cells and tissues, as well as the bodys means of responding to and repairing injury. Areas of study include cellular adaptation to injury, necrosis, inflammation, wound healing, and neoplasia. It forms the foundation of pathology, the application of this knowledge to diagnose diseases in humans and animals. The term general pathology is also used to describe the practice of both anatomical and clinical pathology. Anatomical pathology (Commonwealth) or anatomic pathology (United States) is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the gross, microscopic, chemical, immunologic and molecular examination of organs, tissues, and whole bodies (autopsy). Anatomical pathology is itself divided in subspecialties, the main ones being surgical pathology, cytopathology, and forensic pathology. Anatomical pathology is one of two branches of pathology, the other being clinical pathology, the diagnosis of disease through the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids and tissues. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as general pathology. The distinction between anatomic and clinical pathology is increasingly blurred by the introduction of technologies that require new expertise and the need to provide patients and referring physicians with integrated diagnostic reports. Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology. Clinical pathology is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids such as blood and urine, and tissues using the tools of chemistry, microbiology, hematology and molecular pathology. Clinical pathologists work in close collaboration with medical technologists, hospital administrations, and referring physicians to ensure the accuracy and optimal utilization of laboratory testing. Clinical pathology is one of the two major divisions of pathology, the other being anatomical pathology. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination sometimes known as general pathology.</English>

		<German>Die naturwissenschaftlich als veraltet geltende, jedoch von den Geisteswissenschaften und von der rationalen Psychologie als aufschlussreich beurteilte Humoralpathologie oder Viers&#228;ftelehre wurde von den Hippokratikern in ihrer Schrift &#220;ber die Natur des Menschen (um 400 v. Chr.) ausgehend von der Elementenlehre des Empedokles (490 bis 430 v. Chr.) als Konzept zur Erkl&#228;rung allgemeiner K&#246;rpervorg&#228;nge und als Krankheitskonzept entwickelt und von Galenos in ihrer endg&#252;ltigen Form niedergeschrieben. Bis zur Aufkl&#228;rung dominierte diese Lehre die Naturwissenschaften und auch die damalige Medizin. Die Urspr&#252;nge der Viers&#228;ftelehre k&#246;nnen im alten &#196;gypten vermutet werden. Als Lebenstr&#228;ger im K&#246;rper wurden dort wei&#223;e Galle, schwarze Galle, Blut und Schleim angenommen. Diese Elemente werden &#252;ber das Blut und auch &#252;ber die Nerven im K&#246;rper verbreitet. Hippokrates lehrte, dass der Anteil der K&#246;rpers&#228;fte mit den Jahreszeiten schwankt. Winter: Der Schleim (das Wasserelement) ist am k&#228;ltesten, er &#252;berwiegt. Fr&#252;hling: Das Blut (das Luftelement) nimmt infolge des Regens und der zunehmend warmen Tage zu, obzwar der Schleim im K&#246;rper noch stark ist. Sommer: Die gelbe Galle (Feuerelement) steigt wegen der hei&#223;ene Tage im K&#246;rper an. Das Blut besitzt noch St&#228;rke. Herbst: Die Galle beherrscht den K&#246;rper wie im Sommer auch im Herbst, im Herbst gewinnt die schwarze Galle (das Erdelement) die Oberhand. Medizingeschichtlich bedeutsam erscheint, dass bereits Hippokrates den Charakter der Medizin als Erfahrungswissenschaft begr&#252;ndete. Hippokrates hat sich dabei wohl an Heraklit angelehnt. So ist der Gegensatzcharakter der Elemente- und Viers&#228;ftelehre zu verstehen. Diese Betrachtung ist medizinhistorisch von Interesse, da die psychophysische Korrelation und damit das Leib-Seele-Problem angesprochen wird.</German>

		<English>Logic is the formal systematic study of the principles of valid inference and correct reasoning. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of philosophy, mathematics, semantics, and computer science. Logic examines general forms which arguments may take, which forms are valid, and which are fallacies. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: epistemology, ethics, metaphysics. In mathematics, it is the study of valid inferences within some formal language. Logic is also studied in argumentation theory. Logic was studied in several ancient civilizations, including the Indian subcontinent, China and Greece. Logic was established as a discipline by Aristotle, who gave it a fundamental place in philosophy. The study of logic was part of the classical trivium. The earliest sustained work on the subject of logic is that of Aristotle. Aristotelian logic became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th century. Aristotles system of logic was responsible for the introduction of hypothetical syllogism, temporal modal logic, and inductive logic. In Europe during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotles ideas were compatible with Christian faith. During the later period of the Middle Ages, logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments. The Chinese logical philosopher Gongsun Long (ca. 325250 BC) proposed the paradox "One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two." In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the Qin dynasty following the legalist philosophy of Han Feizi. Logic in Islamic philosophy, particularly Avicennas logic, was heavily influenced by Aristotelian logic.</English>

		<German>Logik ist die Lehre des vern&#252;nftigen (Schluss)Folgerns. Die europ&#228;isch-westliche Logik hat ihren Anfang im antiken Griechenland. Zu den Vorl&#228;ufern der Logik geh&#246;ren die Vorsokratiker, die Sophisten und Platon (ca.428-ca.348 v. Chr.). Die platonische Besch&#228;ftigung mit der Ordnung und den Gesetzen des Denkens ist wohl als Antwort auf die willk&#252;rliche, oft mutwillig in die Irre f&#252;hrende Begriffs- und Argumentationsakrobatik der Sophisten zu sehen. Kann man bei Platon zwar nicht von einem ausgearbeiteten System der Logik sprechen, so findet man in seinen Dialogen doch vieles verstreut, das direkt auf die Logik seines Sch&#252;lers Aristoteles eingewirkt hat. Ein erstes System der Logik findet man dann bei Aristoteles (384-322 v. Chr.), der nicht nur als Begr&#252;nder der Logik gilt, sondern auch von unvergleichbarer Bedeutung f&#252;r die Geschichte der Logik und ihre Entwicklung war. Sein logisches Werk Organon besteht aus sechs Einzelschriften, in denen alle wesentlichen Teile der Logik behandelt werden: der Begriff (Kategorien), die aus Begriffen bestehende Aussage (De Interpretatione) und der aus Aussagen bestehende Schluss (Analytica Priora und Analytica Posteriora). Weiters wird die Praxis des Schlussfolgerns behandelt (Topik und Sophistische Widerlegungen), au&#223;er im Organon kommen auch im vierten Buch der Metaphysik logische Probleme zur Sprache. Die aristotelische Logik ist ein logisches System, in dem Begriffe zueinander in Beziehung gesetzt werden. Es handelt sich also nicht um eine Aussagenlogik, sondern um eine Term- oder Begriffslogik. In der unmittelbaren Nachgeschichte geriet Aristoteles Logik schnell in Vergessenheit, bis in die Sp&#228;tantike dominierte die stoische Aussagenlogik. Erst im Mittelalter beginnt sie zu dominieren und die Entwicklung der Logik entscheidend zu beeinflussen. Auch das Mittelalter bildet eine wichtige Epoche f&#252;r die Geschichte der Logik. Sie war stark beeinflusst durch die-u.a. &#252;ber Vermittlung der arabischen Logik bekannte-Logik des Aristoteles. Im mittelalterlichen Universit&#228;tsbetrieb hatte die Logik als eine der septem artes liberales ihren Platz in der sogenannten Artistenfakult&#228;t (facultas artium). Das Studium der artes war Voraussetzung f&#252;r das Studium an allen anderen Fakult&#228;ten. Im Fr&#252;hmittelalter (etwa vor 1100) orientierte man sich zun&#228;chst an den enzyklop&#228;dischen Werken der Sp&#228;tantike (von Cassiodor, Isidor, Martianus Capella). Seit dem 12. Jh. umfasste der Unterrichtsstoff der Logik dann drei separate Textkorpora</German>

		<Spanish>La l&#243;gica es una ciencia formal que estudia los principios de la demostraci&#243;n e inferencia v&#225;lida. La palabra deriva del griego antiguo logike, que significa dotado de raz&#243;n, intelectual, dial&#233;ctico, argumentativo, que a su vez viene de logos, palabra, pensamiento, idea, argumento, raz&#243;n o principio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La l&#243;gica examina la validez de los argumentos en t&#233;rminos de su estructura l&#243;gica, independientemente del contenido espec&#237;fico del discurso y de la lengua utilizada en su expresi&#243;n y de los estados reales a los que dicho contenido se pueda referir.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Esto es exactamente lo que quiere decir que la l&#243;gica es una ciencia formal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tradicionalmente ha sido considerada como una parte de la filosof&#237;a. Pero en su desarrollo hist&#243;rico, a partir del final del siglo XIX, y su formalizaci&#243;n simb&#243;lica ha mostrado su &#237;ntima relaci&#243;n con las matem&#225;ticas; de tal forma que algunos la consideran como L&#243;gica matem&#225;tica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el siglo XX la l&#243;gica ha pasado a ser principalmente la l&#243;gica simb&#243;lica. Un c&#225;lculo definido por unos s&#237;mbolos y unas reglas de inferencia. Lo que ha permitido un campo de aplicaci&#243;n fundamental en la actualidad: la inform&#225;tica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hasta entonces la l&#243;gica no tuvo este sentido de estructura formal estricta. La tradici&#243;n aristot&#233;lica y estoica, mantuvo siempre una relaci&#243;n con los argumentos del lenguaje natural, concediendo por tanto a los argumentos una transmisi&#243;n de contenidos verdaderos. Por ello a&#250;n siendo formales, no eran formalistas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hoy, tras los progresos cient&#237;ficos relativos a la ling&#252;&#237;stica, y el concepto sem&#225;ntico de verdad en su relaci&#243;n con el lenguaje, tal relaci&#243;n se trata bajo un punto de vista completamente diferente.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La formalizaci&#243;n estricta ha mostrado las limitaciones de la l&#243;gica tradicional interpretada actualmente como una particularidad de la l&#243;gica de clases.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La l&#243;gica, como un an&#225;lisis expl&#237;cito de los m&#233;todos de razonamiento, se desarroll&#243; originalmente en tres civilizaciones de la historia antigua: China, India y Grecia, entre el siglo V y el siglo I a. C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En China no dur&#243; mucho tiempo: la traducci&#243;n y la investigaci&#243;n escolar en l&#243;gica fue reprimida por la dinast&#237;a Qin, acorde con la filosof&#237;a legista. En India, la l&#243;gica dur&#243; bastante m&#225;s: se desarroll&#243; (por ejemplo con la ny&#257;ya) hasta que en el mundo isl&#225;mico apareci&#243; la escuela de Asharite, la cual suprimi&#243; parte del trabajo original en l&#243;gica. A pesar de lo anterior, hubo innovaciones escol&#225;sticas indias hasta principios del siglo XIX, pero no sobrevivi&#243; mucho dentro de la India colonial. El tratamiento sofisticado y formal de la l&#243;gica moderna aparentemente proviene de la tradici&#243;n griega.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se considera a Arist&#243;teles el fundador de la l&#243;gica como proped&#233;utica o herramienta b&#225;sica para todas las ciencias. Arist&#243;teles fue el primero en formalizar los razonamientos, utilizando letras para representar t&#233;rminos. Tambi&#233;n fue el primero en emplear el t&#233;rmino l&#243;gica para referirse al estudio de los argumentos dentro del lenguaje apof&#225;ntico como manifestador de la verdad en la ciencia. Sostuvo que la verdad se manifiesta en el juicio verdadero y el argumento v&#225;lido en el silogismo: Silogismo es un argumento en el cual, establecidas ciertas cosas, resulta necesariamente de ellas, por ser lo que son, otra cosa diferente. Se refiri&#243; en varios escritos de su &#211;rganon a cuestiones tales como concepto, la proposici&#243;n, definici&#243;n, prueba y falacia. En su principal obra l&#243;gica, los Primeros anal&#237;ticos, desarroll&#243; el silogismo, un sistema l&#243;gico de estructura r&#237;gida. Arist&#243;teles tambi&#233;n formaliz&#243; el cuadro de oposici&#243;n de los juicios y categoriz&#243; las formas v&#225;lidas del silogismo. Adem&#225;s, Arist&#243;teles reconoci&#243; y estudi&#243; los argumentos inductivos, base de lo que constituye la ciencia experimental, cuya l&#243;gica est&#225; estrechamente ligada al m&#233;todo cient&#237;fico. La influencia de los logros de Arist&#243;teles fue tan grande, que en el siglo XVIII, Immanuel Kant lleg&#243; a decir que Arist&#243;teles hab&#237;a pr&#225;cticamente completado la ciencia de la l&#243;gica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los fil&#243;sofos estoicos introdujeron el silogismo hipot&#233;tico y anunciaron la l&#243;gica proposicional, pero no tuvo mucho desarrollo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Por otro lado, la l&#243;gica informal fue cultivada por la ret&#243;rica, la oratoria y la filosof&#237;a, entre otras ramas del conocimiento. Estos estudios se centraron principalmente en la identificaci&#243;n de falacias y paradojas, as&#237; como en la construcci&#243;n correcta de los discursos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el periodo romano la l&#243;gica tuvo poco desarrollo, m&#225;s bien se hicieron sumarios y comentarios a las obras recibidas, siendo los m&#225;s notables: Cicer&#243;n, Porfirio y Boecio. En el per&#237;odo bizantino, Filop&#243;n.</Spanish>

		<English>The Hippocratic Oath is an oath historically taken by doctors swearing to practice medicine ethically. It is widely believed to have been written by Hippocrates, often regarded as the father of western medicine, in Ionic Greek (late 5th century BC), or by one of his students, and is usually included in the Hippocratic Corpus. Classical scholar Ludwig Edelstein proposed that the oath was written by Pythagoreans, a theory that has been questioned due to the lack of evidence for a school of Pythagorean medicine. Although mostly of historic and traditional value, the oath is considered a rite of passage for practitioners of medicine in some countries, although nowadays the modernized version of the text varies among the countries. The Hippocratic Oath (orkos) is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. It requires a new physician to swear upon a number of healing gods that he will uphold a number of professional ethical standards.

I will apply dietic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice. I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art. I will not use the knife, not even on sufferers from stone, but will withdraw in favor of such men as are engaged in this work. Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, of all mischief and in particular of sexual relations with both female and male persons, be they free or slaves. What I may see or hear in the course of treatment or even outside of the treatment in regard to the life of men, which on no account one must spread abroad, I will keep myself holding such things shameful to be spoken about. If I fulfill this oath and do not violate it, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and art, being honoured with fame among all men for all time to come; if I transgress it and swear falsely, may the opposite of all this be my lot.</English>
		<French>The Hippocratic Oath is an oath historically taken by doctors swearing to practice medicine ethically. It is widely believed to have been written by Hippocrates, often regarded as the father of western medicine, in Ionic Greek (late 5th century BC), or by one of his students, and is usually included in the Hippocratic Corpus. Classical scholar Ludwig Edelstein proposed that the oath was written by Pythagoreans, a theory that has been questioned due to the lack of evidence for a school of Pythagorean medicine. Although mostly of historic and traditional value, the oath is considered a rite of passage for practitioners of medicine in some countries, although nowadays the modernized version of the text varies among the countries. The Hippocratic Oath (orkos) is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. It requires a new physician to swear upon a number of healing gods that he will uphold a number of professional ethical standards.

		<German>Der Eid des Hippokrates, benannt nach dem griechischen Arzt Hippokrates von Ks (um 460 bis 370 v. Chr.), gilt als erste grundlegende Formulierung einer &#228;rztlichen Ethik. Die Urheberschaft des Eides ist jedoch noch ungekl&#228;rt. Bei Hippokrates selbst findet sich keine Erw&#228;hnung des Eides, ebenso wenig in zeitgen&#246;ssischen Quellen. Die &#228;lteste bekannte Erw&#228;hnung stammt von Scribonius Largus, einem r&#246;mischen Arzt aus dem Umfeld von Kaiser Claudius, also aus dem 1. Jh. n. Chr. Die zeitliche L&#252;cke zwischen Hippokrates (um 460 bis 370 v. Chr.) und Scribonius Largus wird durch kein Dokument geschlossen. Der Ursprung des Eides verliert sich somit im Dunkel der Geschichte. Der Text ist keineswegs eindeutig. Er wurde zudem in seinem Wortlaut immer wieder angepasst. Dies erleichterte die &#220;bernahme des Eides in die sp&#228;t- und nachantike Welt (Christentum, Islam). Seit der Renaissance bis ins 20. Jahrhundert hinein galt der Eid als Schl&#252;sseldokument antiker &#228;rztlicher Ethik. Seit der Fr&#252;hen Neuzeit verwendeten auch Promotionseide und Fakult&#228;tenstatuten medizinischer Hochschulen Versatzst&#252;cke aus dem Eid des Hippokrates, ebenso die Eide anderer medizinischer Berufe (Hebammen, Apotheker usw.). 1804 wurde der Eid des Hippokrates erstmals als Eid f&#252;r Absolventen der Medizin komplett w&#246;rtlich rezitiert an der Medizinschule von Montpellier</German>

		<English>Astrology is a system of divination founded on the notion that the relative positions of celestial bodies are signs of ormore controversially among astrologerscauses of destiny, personality, human affairs, and natural events. The primary astrological bodies are the sun, moon, and planets; although astrology is commonly characterized as "reading the stars", the stars actually play a minor role. The main focus is on the placement of the seven planets relative to each other and to the signs of the zodiac, though the system does allow reference to fixed stars, asteroids, comets, and various mathematical points of interest as well. As a craft, astrology is a combination of basic astronomy, numerology, and mysticism. In its modern form, it is a classic example of pseudoscience. Historically, astrology was regarded as a technical and learned tradition, sustained in royal courts, cultural centers, and medieval universities, and closely related to the studies of alchemy, meteorology, and medicine. Astrology and astronomy were often synonymous before the modern era, with the desire for predictive and divinatory knowledge one of the motivating factors for astronomical observation. Astronomy began to diverge from astrology in the Muslim world at the turn of the 2nd millennium, and in Europe from the Renaissance through the Enlightenment in 18th century. Eventually, astronomy distinguished itself as the empirical study of celestial objects and phenomena. In the latter half of the 20th century astrology experienced a resurgence of popular interest as a major component of the New Age movement. There are three main branches of astrology, namely Western astrology, Indian astrology, and Chinese or East Asian astrology. The study of Western astrology and the belief in it, as part of astronomy, is first found in a developed form among the ancient Babylonians; and directly or indirectly through the Babylonians, it spread to other nations. It came to Greece about the middle of the 4th century BC, reached Rome before the advent of the Christian era. With the introduction of Greek culture into Egypt, both astronomy and astrology were cultivated in the Nile region during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Astrology was further developed by the Islamic World from the 7th to the 13th century , and in the Europe of the 14th and 15th centuries astrologers were dominating influences at court. The Mayans of Central America and the Aztecs also developed their own form of astrology. The terms astrology and astronomy have long been closely related. An Astrologer is an interpreter of celestial phenomena, while an Astronomer is a predictor of celestial phenomena. Astrology itself can be divided into two camps: "Natural astrologers" (i.e. astronomers) study the motions of the heavenly bodies, timing of eclipses, etc. "Judicial astrologers" study the supposed correlations between the positions of various celestial objects and the affairs of human beings.</English>

		<German>Als Astrologie werden verschiedene Lehren bezeichnet, denen der Anspruch gemeinsam ist, aus den Positionen von Himmelsk&#246;rpern Ereignisse, Schicksal und Pers&#246;nlichkeitsmerkmale von Menschen deuten und tlw. prognostisch n&#228;her bestimmen zu k&#246;nnen. Grundlagen f&#252;r die Deutung sind in der westlichen Astrologie das Horoskop, die Tierkreiszeichen, Aspekte der Himmelsk&#246;rper (Sonne, Mond und Planeten) aus geozentrischer Sicht, H&#228;user oder Felder und in manchen Schulen auch einzelne Sterne. Die Urspr&#252;nge der westlichen Astrologie liegen in Babylonien, Assyrien und &#196;gypten. Den &#228;ltesten erhaltenen Beleg stellt der alt&#228;gyptische Naos der Dekaden aus dem vierten Jahrhundert v. Chr. dar. In noch heute angewandten Grundz&#252;gen wurden im 2. nachchristlichen Jahrhundert die damaligen Ansichten von Claudius Ptolem&#228;us in seinen Tetrabiblos formuliert. Von der westlichen Astrologie zu unterscheiden sind die chinesische, die indische und die alt-amerikanische Astrologie. Astronomie und Astrologie waren im Altertum aufs Engste miteinander verkn&#252;pft. Eine Unterscheidung der zwei Fachgebiete kannte man damals noch nicht. Die Astronomie besorgte die rechnerischen Unterlagen und die Astrologie die Sinndeutung des rhythmischen Geschehens am Himmel. Die beiden gekoppelten Wissensgebiete waren der Priesterkaste vorbehalten. Die Unterscheidung zwischen Astrologie und Astronomie hat sich durch die Etablierung der letzteren als (Natur-)Wissenschaft entwickelt. Urspr&#252;nglich herrschte die Vorstellung, die Gestirne repr&#228;sentierten g&#246;ttliche Herrschergestalten, die in ihrer Ausdeutung als Staatsastrologie das Schicksal der Sterne mit dem Gemeinwesen verkn&#252;pften; erstmals in den alt&#228;gyptischen Tagew&#228;hlkalendern belegt, sp&#228;ter auch in den babylonischen Omenkalendern. Erst in der Mitte des 1. Jahrtausends v. Chr. gewann der Glaube Gestalt, das Schicksal des Einzelnen sei mit Hilfe des Horoskops ablesbar. Dies ging mit der Mantik und der allgemeinen Individualisierung im hellenistischen Bereich einher. Im gleichem Ma&#223;e wie das Christentum sich in Europa ausbreitete und den Polytheismus der Antike zur&#252;ckdr&#228;ngte, verwaisten die astrologischen Lehren in der christlichen Hemisph&#228;re. Erst w&#228;hrend der Renaissance (14.-17. Jahrhundert) erlebte die Astrologie eine Wiedergeburt und wurde bis in das 17. Jahrhundert hinein als Wissenschaft verstanden. Als &#228;ltester Beleg der Himmelsvorstellungen gilt der Kamm des K&#246;nigs Wadj aus der 1. Dynastie im Alten &#196;gypten. Genauer fassbar wird die Kosmologie in den Pyramidentexten, die den Aufstieg des verstorbenen K&#246;nigs zum Himmel schwerpunktm&#228;&#223;ig zum Inhalt haben. Der Himmel galt als Ort der wichtigsten Gottheiten, die in ihrer Anfangsphase ikonografisch nur in Tiererscheinungen auftraten. Die Sargtexte des Mittleren Reichs nahmen im Verlauf die Beschreibungen der himmlischen Sph&#228;re aus den Pyramidentexten dekorativ auf. Unter Sesostris III. widmete man sich der Neustrukturierung des sogenannten Nutbuches, das die &#196;gypter Grundriss des Laufes der Sterne nannten und dessen Anf&#228;nge bis mindestens in die Thinitenzeit datiert (Anfang des dritten Jahrtausends v. Chr.) wird. Beginnend mit astronomischen Beobachtungen im dritten Jahrtausend v. Chr. schufen die Sumerer im zweiten Jahrtausend v. Chr. mit den Zikkurat Stufentempel in Ur oder Uruk, deren Stockwerke die sieben Gestirne Mond, Sonne, Venus, Merkur, Mars, Jupiter und Saturn symbolisierten und den Priestern die Verbindung zu den G&#246;ttern erm&#246;glichen sollten. Sternbilder wurden benannt, beispielsweise wurde der Himmel in drei g&#246;ttliche Bereiche sowie 18 Mondbahn-Sternbilder unterteilt. Sie glaubten, die Bewegung der Gestirne vollziehe sich durch g&#246;ttlichen Einfluss. Die Bezeichnung Chald&#228;er f&#252;r Babylonier wurde zum Synonym f&#252;r Astrologe. In der Sp&#228;tzeit &#196;gyptens tauchte eine neue Form der astrologischen Terminologie in der demotischen Sprache auf, die auf alt&#228;gyptischen Aufzeichnungen als Grundlage aufbaute und mit vereinzelten omenartigen Wertungen aus der Fr&#252;hzeit verbunden waren; beispielsweise wurden Sonnen- und Mondfinsternisse als Verschlucken des Himmels beschrieben. Traditionell wurde bisher die Entstehung von astrologischen Konzepten mit Mesopotamien und Griechenland verbunden, jedoch &#196;gypten marginalisiert. Das analysierte &#228;gyptische Textmaterial weist in eine andere Richtung. Die mesopotamischen Schriften gelangten zun&#228;chst nach &#196;gypten und vermischten sich mit religi&#246;s-astronomischen Vorlagen aus Alexandria. Ein klares Beispiel sind die auch heute noch im Gebrauch befindlichen Symbole der Zodiakzeichen. Entscheidenden Einfluss &#252;bte Dorotheos von Sidon im ersten Jahrhundert n. Chr. aus. Im Hellenismus werden zun&#228;chst astrologia (der verbreitetere und &#228;ltere Begriff) und astronomia nicht klar voneinander geschieden. Die erste begriffliche Trennung erfolgte durch Simplikios. Die Griechen &#252;bernahmen die babylonischen Planetennamen. &#220;ber Griechenland fand die Astrologie den Weg nach Rom, wo sie sich als eine von vielen Wahrsageformen gro&#223;er Beliebtheit erfreute. Gerade die r&#246;mischen Kaiser griffen gerne auf sie zur&#252;ck. Wenn sie nicht selbst in der Sterndeutung bewandert waren wie Tiberius, Septimius Severus und Hadrian, hatten sie h&#228;ufig einen Hofastrologen. Kaiser Augustus lie&#223; sogar sein Sternzeichen, den Capricorn (Steinbock), auf M&#252;nzen abbilden. Gleichzeitig versuchten die r&#246;mischen Kaiser aber auch immer wieder, die private Nutzung der Astrologie einzuschr&#228;nken. In der Antike fand die Astrologie Einfluss und Aufnahme in Alchemie, Gnosis, Manich&#228;ismus und Christentum. Das fr&#252;he Christentum bleibt gegen&#252;ber der Astrologie in einem widerspr&#252;chlichen Verh&#228;ltnis, da nach Auffassung vieler Kirchenlehrer die Vorherbestimmung des Schicksals dem freien Willen als unbedingter Voraussetzung (conditio sine qua non) des christlichen Glaubens widerspricht, andererseits ein astronomisches Ereignis mit einer astrologischen Aussage bez&#252;glich der Geburt Christi verbunden wurde. Wird die T&#228;tigkeit der Weisen aus dem Morgenland (Matth&#228;us 2) urspr&#252;nglich als Kunst angesehen, so sind sie nach Hieronymus docti a daemonibus (von D&#228;monen belehrt). Erst Beda Venerabilis beschreibt sie als angesehene Heilige drei K&#246;nige. Tertullian warnt vor der Astrologie. Konstantin der Gro&#223;e bekennt sich dazu. Die Kirche des Mittelalters sieht zu einigen Zeiten in den astralen M&#228;chten sogar den Todfeind des Glaubens.</German>

Supone el llegar a ese conocimiento mediante la observaci&#243;n de la posici&#243;n de los astros y las caracter&#237;sticas comunes de muchas personas con fechas de nacimiento id&#233;nticas. Las personas que estudian la astrolog&#237;a sostienen que las posiciones de los astros tendr&#237;an relaci&#243;n con los rasgos de la personalidad de una persona, con los sucesos importantes de su vida y con sus caracter&#237;sticas f&#237;sicas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los or&#237;genes de la astrolog&#237;a se mezclan con los de la astronom&#237;a, ya que pr&#225;cticamente todas las civilizaciones han acudido a los astros tratando de averiguar el destino de los seres humanos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La astrolog&#237;a, tal y como se la conoce en la actualidad, fue creada en Babilonia hace m&#225;s de cuatro milenios.

		<English>A trireme (from Latin triremis, literally three-oarer) was a type of galley, a Hellenistic-era warship that was used by the ancient maritime civilizations of the Mediterranean, especially the Phoenicians, ancient Greeks and Romans. The trireme derives its name from its three rows of oars on each side, manned with one man per oar. The early trireme was a development of the penteconter, an ancient warship with a single row of 25 oars on each side, and of the bireme , a warship with two banks of oars, probably of Phoenician origin.

Triremes played a vital role in the Persian Wars, the creation of the Athenian maritime empire, and its downfall in the Peloponnesian War. The exact origin of the trireme is uncertain and debated, as our evidence comes from literary sources, depictions in reliefs and pottery fragments, which are open to misinterpretations.

According to Thucydides, the trireme was introduced to Greece by the Corinthians in the late 8th century BC, and the Corinthian Ameinocles built four such ships for the Samians. Although this was interpreted by later writers, Pliny and Diodorus, to mean that triremes were invented in Corinth, it is likely that the earliest three-tiered warships originated in Phoenicia. Fragments from an 8th century relief at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh depicting the fleets of Tyre and Sidon have been interpreted as depicting two- and three-level warships, fitted with rams.

		<French>A trireme (from Latin triremis, literally three-oarer) was a type of galley, a Hellenistic-era warship that was used by the ancient maritime civilizations of the Mediterranean, especially the Phoenicians, ancient Greeks and Romans. The trireme derives its name from its three rows of oars on each side, manned with one man per oar. The early trireme was a development of the penteconter, an ancient warship with a single row of 25 oars on each side, and of the bireme , a warship with two banks of oars, probably of Phoenician origin.

		<German>Die Triere (griechisch) oder Trireme (lateinisch, beides zu deutsch: Dreiruderer) war ein rudergetriebenes Kriegsschiff des Altertums mit drei gestaffelt angeordneten Reihen von Riemen. Sie war vom 6. bis zum 3. Jahrhundert v. Chr. das wichtigste Kriegsschiff der Seem&#228;chte im Mittelmeer. Die Triere wurde aus der Diere (mit zwei Ruderreihen) entwickelt, mit der Absicht, durch eine gr&#246;&#223;ere Zahl von Ruderern das Schiff noch schneller zu machen. Die damals wirksamste Taktik im Kampf Schiff gegen Schiff war das Rammen des Gegners, deren Wirkung mit der Geschwindigkeit zunahm. Herodot erw&#228;hnt Trieren in Flotten des 6. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. Durch die Verlagerung des Taktikschwerpunktes vom Rammsto&#223; zum Enterkampf wurde die Beweglichkeit der Schiffe immer weniger relevant. Daf&#252;r versuchte man, die Trieren weiter zu vergr&#246;&#223;ern, um noch mehr Wurfmaschinen und Soldaten mitnehmen zu k&#246;nnen und so im Mle zu gewinnen. Da es aus konstruktiven und koordinativen Gr&#252;nden nicht m&#246;glich war, die Zahl der Ruderreihen weiter zu vergr&#246;&#223;ern, musste man die Riemen selbst gr&#246;&#223;er gestalten. Diese wurden schlie&#223;lich zu gro&#223;, um von einem Mann alleine bedient zu werden. Also wurden entweder die oberste, oder die oberen beiden oder alle drei Riemenreihen von je zwei Ruderern bedient. Daraus entstanden Typenbezeichnungen wie Quadrireme, Quinquereme und Hexere, die sich alle auf die Anzahl der Ruderer beziehen. Mit dem Aufstieg Roms zur einzigen Seemacht im Mittelmeer wurde die neue Hauptaufgabe der r&#246;mischen Flotte die Jagd auf Piraten. Dazu waren die Trieren zu schwer und zu langsam. Kleine schnelle Kriegsschiffe, wie die Liburne, wurden zur neuen Hauptwaffe der Flotte. Trieren kamen allerdings als einziger gr&#246;&#223;erer Schiffstyp neben einzelnen Flaggschiffen durchaus auch noch in der kaiserzeitlichen r&#246;mischen Flotte vor. Sie werden zuletzt f&#252;r das Jahr 323 erw&#228;hnt. Der sp&#228;tantike Geschichtsschreiber Zosimos berichtet dann um 500, die Kunst, Trieren zu bauen, sei mittlerweile vergessen. Als die Ostr&#246;mer dann unter Justinian I. erneut eine starke Flotte aufbauten, traten Dromonen an die Stelle der alten Dreiruderer.</German>

		<English>Pharmacy is the health profession that links the health sciences with the chemical sciences and it is charged with ensuring the safe and effective use of pharmaceutical drugs. The word derives from the Greek pharmakon, meaning "drug" or "medicine". An establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a pharmacy or chemists. Paleopharmacological studies attest to the use of medicinal plants in pre-history. The earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was ARIANA the Sushruta Samhita, an Indian Ayurvedic treatise attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BC. However, the earliest text as preserved dates to the 3rd or 4th century AD. Many Sumerian (late 6th millennium BC-early 2nd millennium BC) cuneiform clay tablets record prescriptions for medicine. Ancient Egyptian pharmacological knowledge was recorded in various papyri such as the Ebers Papyrus of 1550 BC, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus of the 16th century BC. In Ancient Greece, according to Edward Kremers and Glenn Sonnedecker, "before, during and after the time of Hippocrates there was a group of experts in medicinal plants. Probably the most important representative of these rhizotomoi was Diocles of Carystus (4th century BC). He is considered to be the source for all Greek pharmacotherapeutic treatises between the time of Theophrastus and Dioscorides." The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five volume book in his native Greek in the 1st century AD. The Latin translation De Materia Medica (Concerning medical substances) was used a basis for many medieval texts, and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age. The title coined the term materia medica.</English>

		<German>Pharmazie (v. griech. pharmacon, Heilmittel, Gift, Zaubermittel) oder Pharmazeutik ist eine Wissenschaft, die sich mit der Beschaffenheit, Wirkung, Entwicklung, Pr&#252;fung, Herstellung und Abgabe von Arzneimitteln in der Industrie und den Apotheken befasst. F&#252;r die Anf&#228;nge und die weitere Entwicklung der abendl&#228;ndischer Pharmazie waren die Heilkunde der Antike und Einfl&#252;sse aus dem byzantinischen wie vor allem dem arabischislamischen Kulturkreis bestimmend bis in die Neuzeit hinein. Nach dem Niedergang des westr&#246;mischen Reiches lag die Heilkunde zun&#228;chst in den H&#228;nden der Kl&#246;ster, die zugleich Heils- und Heilst&#228;tten waren.

Regional wie zeitlich bestehen dabei Unterschiede, so dass die Frage nach der ersten Apotheke nicht pauschal beantwortet werden kann.

		<Spanish>La farmacia (del griego f&#225;rmakon, 'medicamento, veneno, t&#243;xico') es la ciencia y pr&#225;ctica de la preparaci&#243;n, conservaci&#243;n, presentaci&#243;n y dispensaci&#243;n de medicamentos; tambi&#233;n es el lugar donde se preparan, dispensan y venden los productos medicinales. Esta definici&#243;n es la m&#225;s universal y cl&#225;sica que se solapa con el concepto de Farmacia Gal&#233;nica (Galeno fue un m&#233;dico griego del siglo II experto en preparar medicamentos).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el tercer milenio antes de Cristo se inicia el desenvolvimiento simult&#225;neo en: India, Mesopotamia, Egipto y China. Entre los f&#225;rmacos que se utilizaron est&#225;n: el ruibarbo, el opio y la ephedrina s&#237;nica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el caso de India estuvieron influenciados por la filosof&#237;a v&#233;dica, por lo que la bot&#225;nica ten&#237;a una funci&#243;n prominente y se crearon el SOMA y el KUSA. De acuerdo con la filosof&#237;a budista, los remedios eran dulces (ac&#243;nito, jengibre, lino...).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En Mesopotamia existen testimonios del uso y preparaci&#243;n de medicamentos de m&#225;s de cuatro mil a&#241;os. De hecho en la cultura babil&#243;nica-asiria est&#225;n los primeros indicios del uso de f&#225;rmacos y detectaron la peligrosidad y dosificaci&#243;n de las sustancias administr&#225;ndoselas a esclavos. Utilizaban ung&#252;entos a base de planta haoma para una bebida sagrada, belladona contra los espasmos o excrementos humanos como curativos. Los sumerios llevaron a cabo las primeras operaciones farmac&#233;uticas (desecaci&#243;n, pulverizaci&#243;n, molienda, prensado, filtraci&#243;n, decantaci&#243;n, etc) y propusieron formas farmac&#233;uticas como pomadas, lociones, cataplasmas, enemas, infusiones, vinos, emplastos...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En Egipto los c&#243;dices describen la sintomatolog&#237;a y la prescripci&#243;n para una enfermedad, as&#237; como los principios activos de plantas, animales y minerales, los alimentos que los contienen (leche, vino, miel...) y la formulaci&#243;n y preparaci&#243;n de medicamentos. Adem&#225;s, establec&#237;an unas pautas de administraci&#243;n de los medicamentos, a saber de uso interno (tisanas, decocciones, maceraciones, p&#237;ldoras...) y de uso externo (cataplasmas, ung&#252;entos, emplastos, colirios, pomadas, inhalaciones...). Las enfermedades m&#225;s comunes eran las oft&#225;lmicas, parasitarias y enfermedades de bajo vientre que se trataban con supositorios, enemas o laxantes. Los procedimientos tor&#225;cicos se trataban con inhalaciones y las enfermedades de la piel con ung&#252;entos. Como herramientas de trabajo usaban molinos de mano, morteros, tamices fabricados con papiro, balanzas, y para la conservaci&#243;n: recipientes de barro, vidrio, alabastro y serpentina, as&#237; como cajas de madera.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En Grecia y Roma (desde el siglo IV a. C. al a&#241;o 476 d. C) se inicia la medicina racional con Alcme&#243;n de Crotona hasta la medicina posterior de Galeno. En este per&#237;odo se hace notar la influencia religiosa, no exist&#237;a la figura del farmac&#233;utico como tal, pero aparece la farmacia Gal&#233;nica. Galeno da las bases t&#233;cnicas para la preparaci&#243;n de las principales formas farmac&#233;uticas y se conocen los primeros auxiliares de la medicina: Rizotomos, Farmacopolos, los picmentarios y los ung&#252;entarios. Se distinguen igual que en Egipto los f&#225;rmacos de uso externo (pomadas, esparadrapos, ung&#252;entos...) y los de uso interno (infusiones, decocciones, fermentaciones...) y se descubre la "terra sigillata", que permite crear pastillas preparadas con la base de una arcilla blanca, el bolus alba, y empastadas con sangre de cagra, seg&#250;n escritos de Diosc&#243;rides. Este hombre es el llamado padre de la farmacolog&#237;a y es quien consolida la separaci&#243;n de la farmacia y la medicina en el medio oriente, siendo los &#225;rabes los encargados de esta separaci&#243;n. Por otra parte, Avicena describe varias formas farmac&#233;uticas para administrar los medicamentos: papelillos, tabletas, jarabes, polvo, ung&#252;entos, ba&#241;os arom&#225;ticos, aceites, tinturas, gotas medicinales, laxantes, lavativas, etc.</Spanish>

		<English>Elephants have been working animals used in various capacities by humans. Seals found in the Indus Valley suggest that the elephant was first domesticated in ancient India. However, elephants have never been truly domesticated: the male elephant in his periodic condition of musth is dangerous and difficult to control. Therefore, elephants used by humans have typically been female, war elephants being an exception; as female elephants in battle will run from a male, only males could be used in war. It is generally more economical to capture wild young elephants and tame them than to breed them in captivity. War elephants were used by armies in the Indian subcontinent, the Warring States of China, and later by the Persian Empire. This use was adopted by Hellenistic armies after Alexander the Great experienced their worth against King Porus, notably in the Ptolemaic and Seleucid diadoch empires. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took elephants across the Alps when he was fighting the Romans, but brought too few elephants to be of much military use, although his horse cavalry was quite successful; he probably used a now-extinct third African subspecies, the North African forest elephant, smaller than its two southern cousins, and presumably easier to domesticate. A large elephant in full charge could cause tremendous damage to infantry, and cavalry horses would be afraid of them.</English>

		<German>Seit wenigstens 3.500 Jahren fangen, zahmen und dressieren Menschen Elefanten. Doch Elefanten wurden nie planm&#228;&#223;ig gez&#252;chtet und dabei der Umwelt des Menschen angepasst, wie es mit typischen Haustieren wie etwa Rind, Pferd oder Haushund geschah und immer noch geschieht. Gez&#228;hmte und abgerichtete Elefanten sind keine domestizierten, sondern Wildtiere in Menschenobhut und die meisten von ihnen wurden und werden immer noch aus Wildbestanden gefangen. Im 15. vorchristlichen Jahrhundert entstanden in Nordostindien und S&#252;dchina fast gleichzeitig Elefantenkulturen bei jagenden Stammen, die ihre Praktiken ge&#228;ndert hatten, den Elefanten als ihr Totem betrachteten und ihn zwar jagten, aber nicht t&#246;teten. Kleine Gruppen von J&#228;gern fingen selektiv junge Elefanten in Boden oder Handschlingen. Sp&#228;ter lernten einige dieser Kulturen, auf dem R&#252;cken zahmer Elefanten reitend sich unbemerkt wilden Artgenossen zu n&#228;hern, um sie mit Schlingen fangen zu k&#246;nnen. F&#252;r die Stammesangeh&#246;rigen waren die Elefanten Statussymbol, Reit- und Transporttiere und sp&#228;ter wahrend Feudal- und Kolonialzeiten auch Handelsobjekte. Im Altertum und Mittelalter besa&#223;en die buddhistischen, hinduistischen und sp&#228;ter die islamistischen Herrscherfamilien das Elefantenmonopol. Sie verlangten nach gro&#223;en Elefantenbestanden. Die Tierriesen waren Statussymbole, fanden Verwendung beim Transport und beim Bau von Tempeln, Pal&#228;sten und Staud&#228;mmen. Sie wirkten als Scharfrichter, als Kampf-und Kriegselefanten. Beim Bau der Tempelanlagen von Angkhor (1113 bis 1115) fanden neben 100.000 Menschen auch 60.000 Elefanten Arbeit. Die indischen Gro&#223;reiche der Maurya (322 bis 185 v.Chr.), der Delhi Sultane (1200 bis 1526) oder der Moghulen (1527 bis 1700) hielten Herden von wenigstens 3.000 bis 40.000 Elefanten. Bereits im vierten vorchristlichen Jahrhundert exportierten indische Reiche j&#228;hrlich Hunderte von Elefanten in den Nahen und Mittleren Orient und nach Zentralchina als Tauschmittel f&#252;r Pferde, die im Kernraum der Elefantenkulturen &#228;u&#223;erst krankheitsanf&#228;llig waren. Vor 2.300Jahren, als die Mittelmeermachte ihre Armeen ausbauten, f&#252;hrten sudindische Experten die Kunst des Z&#228;hmens und F&#252;hrens von Afrikanischen Elefanten in &#196;gypten und sp&#228;ter in Karthago und Axum (Athiopien) ein. Viele der Elefanten in S&#252;dasien kamen als Tribute von Vasallen und als Kriegsbeute in die St&#228;lle der Feudalherren. Zus&#228;tzliche Tiere kauften sie von Stammesangeh&#246;rigen oder befreundeten M&#228;chten.</German>

		<Spanish>Los elefantes o elef&#225;ntidos (Elephantidae) son una familia de mam&#237;feros placentarios del orden Proboscidea. Antiguamente se clasificaban, junto con otros animales de piel gruesa, en el orden, ahora inv&#225;lido, de los paquidermos (Pachydermata). Existen hoy en d&#237;a tres especies y diversas subespecies. Entre los g&#233;neros extintos de esta familia destacan los mamuts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los elefantes son los animales terrestres m&#225;s grandes que existen actualmente. El periodo de gestaci&#243;n es de 22 meses, el m&#225;s largo en cualquier animal terrestre. El peso al nacer usualmente es 120 kg. Normalmente viven de 50 a 70 a&#241;os, pero registros antiguos documentan edades m&#225;ximas de 82 a&#241;os. El elefante m&#225;s grande que se ha cazado, de los que se tiene registro, pes&#243; alrededor de 11.000 kg (Angola, 1956), alcanzando una altura en la cruz de 3,96 m, un metro m&#225;s alto que el elefante africano promedio. El elefante m&#225;s peque&#241;o, de alrededor del tama&#241;o de una cr&#237;a o un cerdo grande, es una especie prehist&#243;rica que existi&#243; en la isla de Creta, Elephas creticus, durante el Pleistoceno.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Con un cerebro de 5 kg, el cerebro del elefante es el m&#225;s grande de los animales terrestres. Se le atribuyen una gran variedad de comportamientos asociados a la inteligencia como el duelo, altruismo, adopci&#243;n, juego, uso de herramientas, compasi&#243;n y autorreconocimiento. Los elefantes pueden estar a la par con otras especies inteligentes como los cet&#225;ceos y algunos primates. Las &#225;reas m&#225;s grandes en su cerebro est&#225;n encargadas de la audici&#243;n, el gusto y la movilidad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La industria del hombre y el furor por hacer da&#241;o a sus enemigos hizo que emplease este enorme cuadr&#250;pedos en la guerra, arm&#225;ndole de diferentes modos, entre ellos unos castilletes o torres de madera, desde donde cierto n&#250;mero de guerreros disparaban armas arrojadizas. Heliodoro fija el n&#250;mero de soldados que montaba la torre en seis. De todos modos, puede juzgarse el da&#241;o que har&#237;a esta especie de fortificaci&#243;n movible, pues adem&#225;s de las flechas y dardos que desped&#237;an sus defensores, el elefante hac&#237;a tambi&#233;n uso de la trompa, puesto que seg&#250;n algunos historiadores, este animal se aficiona mucho a los ejercicios b&#233;licos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La primera vez que le vemos aparecer en escena en la historia militar es en la batalla de Arbela o Arbella (Siria) a&#241;o de 331 antes de Jesucristo en que Dar&#237;o, rey de Persia, los present&#243; en n&#250;mero de 15 en el centro de su l&#237;nea de batalla, contra Alejandro el Grande, el cual a pesar de esto, venci&#243; a su enemigo y le despoj&#243; del reino.

		<English>The dithyramb (dithurambos) was an ancient Greek hymn sung and danced in honour of Dionysus, the god of wine and fertility; the term was also used as an epithet of the god: Plato, in The Laws, while discussing various kinds of music mentions "the birth of Dionysos, called, I think, the dithyramb." Plato also remarks of dithyrambs in the Republic (394BC) that they are the clearest example of poetry in which the poet is the only speaker. Plutarch contrasted the dithyrambs wild and ecstatic character with the paean. According to Aristotle, the dithyramb was the origin of Athenian tragedy. A wildly enthusiastic speech or piece of writing is still occasionally described as dithyrambic. Dithyrambs were sung by choruses at Delos, but the literary fragments that have survived are largely Athenian. In Athens dithyrambs were sung by a Greek chorus of up to fifty men or boys dancing in circular formation (there is no certain evidence that they may have originally been dressed as satyrs) and probably accompanied by the aulos. They would normally relate some incident in the life of Dionysus. The ancient Greeks themselves counted among the special criteria of the dithyramb its special rhythm, its aulos accompaniment in Phrygian mode, its highly-wrought vocabulary, its considerable narrative content, and its originally antistrophic character. Competitions between groups singing and dancing dithyrambs were an important part of Dionysiac festivals such as the Dionysia and Lenaia. Each tribe would enter two choruses, one of men and one of boys, each under the leadership of a coryphaeus. The results of dithyrambic contests in Athens were recorded, with the names of the winning teams and their choregoi recorded, but not the poets, most of whom remain unknown. The successful choregos would receive a statue that would be erected-at his own expense-as a public monument to commemorate the victory. The earliest mention of dithyramb found by Sir Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge, is in a fragment of Archilochus, who flourished in the first half of the seventh century BCE: "I know how to lead the fair song of the Lord Dionysus, the dithyramb, when my wits are fused with wine." As a literary composition for chorus, their inspiration is unknown, although it was likely Greek, as Herodotus explicitly speaks of Arion of Lesbos as "the first of men we know to have composed the dithyramb and named it and produced it in Corinth".</English>

		<German>Der Dithyrambus (griechisch: Dithyrambos) war eine Gattung der antiken griechischen Chorlyrik, ein Hymnos zu Ehren des Gottes Dionysos, vorgetragen im Rahmen der Dionysien im Wechselgesang zwischen Chor und Vorsinger. Wie der Dionysos-Kult selbst k&#246;nnte auch der Dithyrambus nicht-griechischen Ursprungs gewesen sein. In Griechenland wird er zun&#228;chst bei Archilochos im 7. Jahrhundert v. Chr. bezeugt, als Vollender des Dithyrambus gilt Arion von Lesbos. Vermutlich entwickelte sich im 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. aus dem Dithyrambus die antike griechische Trag&#246;die. Auch nach deren Entstehung bestand der Dithyrambus fort, etwa bei Pindar oder Bakchylides. Von diesen leidenschaftlich erregten, st&#252;rmischen, ekstatischen Lobliedern auf Dionysos (Gott der Ekstase, des Weines, der Verwandlung) leitet sich die &#252;bertragene Bedeutung des Wortes "dithyrambisch" im Sinne von schw&#228;rmerisch, wild begeistert ab.</German>

		<Spanish>Ditirambo (dithyrambos) es una composici&#243;n l&#237;rica griega dedicada al dios Dioniso; fuera de su contexto propio, se utiliza a veces con el sentido laxo de alabanza exagerada o encomio excesivo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En origen, fue una forma de la l&#237;rica coral griega. El origen de la palabra es desconocido, y probablemente la ra&#237;z no es griega. Su desarrollo como g&#233;nero literario fue obra del poeta Ari&#243;n, en Corinto, durante el &#250;ltimo cuarto del siglo VII a. C. Laso de Herm&#237;one, poeta l&#237;rico arcaico griego, lo llev&#243; a Atenas, y en el 509 a. C. se convirti&#243; en un elemento de competici&#243;n en los festivales dedicados a Dioniso. Sim&#243;nides, P&#237;ndaro y Baqu&#237;lides escribieron ditirambos. De los dos primeros s&#243;lo se conservan fragmentos; en cambio, de Baqu&#237;lides queda bastante. El coro ditir&#225;mbico no lleva m&#225;scara y cantaban en c&#237;rculo en la orchestra. La narraci&#243;n juega un papel importante en estos poemas, pero el tema no tiene por qu&#233; estar relacionado con Dioniso. Despu&#233;s de Baqu&#237;lides el componente musical del ditirambo parece que increment&#243; su importancia a costa de las palabras, pero como la m&#250;sica no ha sobrevivido no podemos discernir lo que ocurri&#243;. Antes de esta &#233;poca el ditirambo se compuso de forma regular en estrofas y ant&#237;strofas, pero a partir de entonces se abandon&#243; esta correspondencia en favor de un estilo de composici&#243;n m&#225;s libre, con solos cantados. El lenguaje se hizo rebuscado y artificial. Tespis, director de un coro del siglo VI aC, cre&#243; el drama al distinguir dos secciones en el coro de un ditirambo: el papel del personaje principal, y el del resto del coro. El personaje principal hablaba y el coro respond&#237;a, lo que, seg&#250;n el Estagirita, era ya impl&#237;citamente una pieza dram&#225;tica que s&#243;lo habr&#237;a de esperar a la incorporaci&#243;n de otros actores y personajes para desarrollarse.</Spanish>

		<English>Chain mail or mail is a type of armor consisting of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The word chainmail is of relatively recent coinage, having been in use only since the 18th century; prior to this it was referred to simply as mail. Mail first appeared some time after 400 BC. and its invention is credited to the Celts. It may have been inspired by the much earlier scale armour. Mail was a highly successful type of armour and was used by nearly every metalworking culture. From its adoption by the Romans in 300 BC to its decline in the 17th and 18th centuries the history of mail was one of proliferation. From its start in Europe it came to be used in North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, Tibet, Korea and finally Japan. Through trade, mail spread around the world yet its basic design remained the same although certain features of mail armour started to change during its journey eastward. The 2500 year history of mail continues into the 21st century as it remains in limited use as a component of stab vests and a number of other applications. Mail is also used in reenactments, decorative uses and jewelry.</English>

		<German>Als Kettenr&#252;stung oder Kettenpanzer (auch: Ringelpanzer oder Panzerhemd; lat.: Lorica hamata) bezeichnet man eine R&#252;stung, die aus zahlreichen ineinander verflochtenen und in der Regel vernieteten kleinen Metallringen besteht. Der genaue Ursprung des Ringpanzers ist nicht bekannt. Aufgrund der arch&#228;ologischen Fundlage wird dieser aber in Mittel- oder Nordeuropa vermutet. Einen der fr&#252;hesten Funde von Ringpanzern stellt der Moorfund von Hjortspring aus dem 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. im heutigen D&#228;nemark dar. Nach Allan Williams stammt der bislang &#228;lteste Nachweis eines Ringpanzerhemdes aus einem keltischen Grab im heutigen Rum&#228;nien, welches in etwa in den gleichen Zeitraum datiert wird. Als m&#246;glichen Vorl&#228;ufer f&#252;r diese R&#252;stungsform nennt dieser Fachautor ein Fragment einer Panzerung aus einem keltischen Grab in B&#246;hmen (wohl 8. Jahrhundert v. Chr.), bei dem die Eisenringe netzartig auf Schn&#252;re aufgef&#228;delt waren. Die R&#246;mer &#252;bernahmen diese R&#252;stungsart wahrscheinlich im 3. Jahrhundert v. Chr. von ihren n&#246;rdlichen Nachbarn und verwendeten sie unter der Bezeichnung Lorica Hamata. Mit ihren Schulterst&#252;cken waren die Loricae Hamatae optisch an den griechischen Linothorax angelehnt. Neben zahlreichen anderen R&#252;stungsarten wurde die Kettenr&#252;stung in der Sp&#228;tantike bis zum Untergang des Westr&#246;mischen Reichs im 5. Jahrhundert n. Chr. verwendet. Im Ostr&#246;mischen Reich blieb sie auch weiterhin in Gebrauch. Bei der r&#246;mischen Kettenr&#252;stung handelte es sich um ein weites Kettenhemd, das bis zur Mitte der Oberschenkel reichen konnte und mit einem verdoppelten Schulterteil versehen war. Auch im Sassanidenreich wurde das Kettenhemd &#252;bernommen. Die Kettenr&#252;stungen wurden meistens aus Ringen aus Eisendraht gefertigt. Funde legen aber nahe, dass die R&#246;mer mitunter auch Bronzeringe verwendeten. Die Ringe wurden dabei oft miteinander vernietet oder verschwei&#223;t. Die R&#246;mer verwendeten als spezielle Technik ein Geflecht aus abwechselnd geschlossenen, gestanzten Ringen und den zusammengebogenen Drahtringen. Nach dem Zusammenbruch des Westr&#246;mischen Reichs gab es lange Zeit keine nennenswerte R&#252;stungsindustrie auf europ&#228;ischem Boden (au&#223;er in Byzanz), was den Wert einer Kettenr&#252;stung noch erh&#246;hte. Die Kettenr&#252;stung war im Fr&#252;hmittelalter im Gro&#223;teil Europas deshalb weniger verbreitet, daneben existierten diverse Arten von g&#252;nstigeren Textil- und Lederr&#252;stungen, zudem Schuppenpanzer. Letzterer bot au&#223;erdem besseren Schutz gegen Wuchtattacken, da er etwas starrer war, insgesamt war er jedoch dem Kettenhemd unterlegen. Im Gegensatz zur r&#246;mischen Kettenr&#252;stung bedeckte die Kettenr&#252;stung des Mittelalters immer gr&#246;&#223;ere Teile des K&#246;rpers. Im 12. und 13. Jahrhundert wurde das Kettenhemd zu einer wichtigen R&#252;stungsform der Ritter. Neben dem Kettenpanzer trug man Kettenhandschuhe, den Topfhelm und die Helmbr&#252;nne.</German>

		<Spanish>Cota de malla se denomina a la protecci&#243;n met&#225;lica conformada por anillas de hierro forjado, o acero, dispuestas de forma que cada anilla est&#225; ensartada al menos a otras cuatro formando un tejido. Esta denominaci&#243;n es una adaptaci&#243;n literal del franc&#233;s cotte de maille que significa t&#250;nica de anillos. En castellano tambi&#233;n se conoce com&#250;nmente como loriga.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La cota de malla era de una especie de camisa o t&#250;nica larga conformada por anillos de metal entrelazados, que pod&#237;an ser de hierro, bronce, o acero, en la que cada anilla se un&#237;a con varios otros eslabones, siendo el patr&#243;n m&#225;s frecuente el de cuatro a uno, si bien tambi&#233;n exist&#237;an otros dise&#241;os. Asimismo, se utilizaba muy extensamente una cofia de mallas, una especie de capucha de anillas entrelazadas, que habitualmente pod&#237;a reemplazar al casco, o complementar al yelmo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Esta malla se confeccionaba con forma de largas camisas que ofrec&#237;an gran resistencia a los cortes y fue inventada posiblemente por los pueblos celtas en el siglo V a. C. y utilizada por los romanos, toda la Edad Media y hasta el siglo XVI. Aunque ofrec&#237;a gran resistencia a los cortes, era vulnerable a armas de puntas delgadas como flechas, excepto las de anillos remachados.[NEWLINE]La cota de malla (lorica hamata en lat&#237;n) era la armadura t&#237;pica en el imperio Romano antes de la introducci&#243;n de la lorica segmentata (armadura segmentada) y continu&#243; en uso entre los auxiliares y legionarios durante todo el periodo imperial. No se conoce la proporci&#243;n de uso entre hamata y segmentata entre los legionarios durante el primer siglo despu&#233;s de Cristo, pero es posible que la primera fuera m&#225;s popular por ser menos costosa. La cota de malla era usada tambi&#233;n por los Vexillarii y signiferii (portadores de banderas y estandartes), los m&#250;sicos y tambi&#233;n los centuriones, adem&#225;s de las tropas auxiliares.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La cota de malla romana estaba fabricada en hierro, con anillos que a veces no superaban los tres mm de di&#225;metro y usaba el conocido patr&#243;n de 4 en 1. Frecuentemente la mitad de los anillos estaban cerrados, ya fueran troquelados a partir de plancha o hechos con alambre soldado, y el resto estaban remachados. Los anillos cerrados ten&#237;an una secci&#243;n aproximadamente cuadrada, es decir, que el grosor del metal era similar a la diferencia entre el di&#225;metro exterior e interior. Los anillos remachados sol&#237;an ser de secci&#243;n circular. Se tienen pruebas de que los anillos sol&#237;an ser esta&#241;ados o incluso dorados.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La cota de malla normalmente no ten&#237;a mangas o eran muy cortas, 12 o 13 cm m&#225;ximo, y llegaba hasta la mitad del muslo. Los hombros estaban protegidos especialmente por una pieza en forma de U unida a la cota por detr&#225;s con una fila de anillos y dejando caer hacia delante los brazos de la U alrededor del cuello y unidos al frente por una pieza met&#225;lica ajustada en unos botones remachados. Esta pieza sol&#237;a estar bordeada con una tira de piel doblada y cosida. Para la caballer&#237;a auxiliar y algunos oficiales esta pieza ten&#237;a una forma circular pareciendo m&#225;s una capa unida por delante con un pasador. Esto podr&#237;a ser una variaci&#243;n de origen c&#233;ltico.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En alg&#250;n momento de finales del siglo I parece que las tropas auxiliares dejaron de utilizar esta pieza sobre los hombros, aunque en los relieves del monumento de Adamklissi a&#250;n se les representa con ella.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las cotas de malla acabadas en zig-zag que se pueden ver en la columna Trajana podr&#237;an ser licencias art&#237;sticas, dado que no se ha encontrado ninguna referencia a los mismos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los ganchos que un&#237;an las piezas de malla en el pecho sol&#237;an ser de bronce fundido aunque tambi&#233;n pod&#237;an confeccionarse con plancha de lat&#243;n o hierro. Los discos de enganche pod&#237;an hacerse tambi&#233;n de lat&#243;n y remacharlos dejando un peque&#241;o espacio para que pasasen los ganchos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Para conseguir la m&#225;xima protecci&#243;n era muy conveniente vestir un subarmalis acolchado debajo de la cota de malla. La malla protege muy bien de los cortes y golpes perforantes, pero protege bastante mal de las contusiones, a diferencia de las armaduras de placas que reparten la fuerza de los golpes por toda la extensi&#243;n de la placa. Es por eso que un acolchado interior multiplica la efectividad de la malla.</Spanish>

		<English>Mosaic is the art of creating images with an assemblage of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials. It may be a technique of decorative art, an aspect of interior decoration, or of cultural and spiritual significance as in a cathedral. Small pieces, normally roughly cubic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture. The earliest known examples of mosaics made of different materials were found at a temple building in Abra, Mesopotamia, and are dated to the second half of 3rd millennium BC. They consist of pieces of colored stones, shells and ivory. Excavations at Susa and Choqa Zanbil show evidence of the first glazed tiles, dating from around 1500 BC. However, mosaic patterns were not used until the times of Sassanid Empire and Roman influence. Mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae and they enriched the floors of Hellenistic villas, and Roman dwellings from Britain to Dura-Europos. The 4th century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrs discovered in Durrs, Albania in 1916, is a rare example of expressionism in portrait during the ancient world. Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across north Africa, in places such as Carthage, and can still be seen in the extensive collection in Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia. In Rome, Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover the surfaces of walls and ceilings in the Domus Aurea, built 64 AD. The mosaics of the Villa Romana del Casale near Piazza Armerina in Sicily are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics in situ in the world, and are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The large villa rustica, which was probably owned by Emperor Maximian, was built largely in the early 4th century. The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th century. The most important pieces are the Circus Scene, the 64 m long Great Hunting Scene, the Little Hunt, the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls, showing women exercising in modern-looking bikinis. The peristyle, the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics. Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus, Alexander the Greats Hunt and the Four Seasons.</English>

		<German>Mosaik ist eine schon im Altertum bekannte Gattung der Maltechnik, die zu den Maltechniken z&#228;hlt, bei der durch Zusammenf&#252;gen von verschiedenfarbigen oder verschieden geformten Teilen (Stein- oder Glasst&#252;cken, auch Teilen von Papier oder Stoffen) Muster oder Bilder entstehen. Das Wort Mosaik leitet sich aus dem sp&#228;tlateinischen Musaicum (opus) (Werk den Musen gewidmet) ab. Als Musivische Technik bezeichnet man das Zusammensetzen von verschiedenfarbigen flachen Pl&#228;ttchen (aus Stein, Metall, Holz, etc.) zu dekorativen Mustern. Zwischen Euphrat und Tigris, in Mesopotamien nahe der Stadt Ur fand man die &#228;ltesten Mosaiken der Welt aus sumerischer Zeit (ca. 2500 bis 3000 v. Chr.) Es handelte sich dabei um S&#228;ulen aus Palmenst&#228;mmen, die eine Ummantelung mit Asphalt (Mischung aus dem Bindemittel Bitumen und Gesteinsk&#246;rnung) aufwiesen und mit Mosaiksteinen verziert waren. Mosaiksteine kamen aber auch als Material f&#252;r Wandfriese in Geb&#228;uden und als Verzierungen von Schmuckk&#228;stchen zum Einsatz. Die ersten Mosaiken in der griechischen Welt sind Kieselmosaiken. Wie der Name besagt, bestehen sie aus ausgew&#228;hlten Kieselsteinen, wobei die Farben Schwarz und Wei&#223; dominieren. Im Hellenismus wurden die Kiesel durch speziell zurecht geschnittene Steine ersetzt. Eine erste Bl&#252;tezeit erlebte das antike Mosaik im zweiten vorchristlichen Jahrhundert. In dieser Zeit wurden gro&#223;e Bildmotive, die den Fu&#223;boden eines ganzen Raumes bedecken konnten, produziert. Das bekannteste Beispiel ist das Alexandermosaik in Pompeji. Besonders im r&#246;mischen Reich waren Mosaiken weit verbreitet. Viele Fu&#223;b&#246;den, aber auch manchmal W&#228;nde in Wohnbauten einer gehobenen sozialen Schicht waren mit Mosaiken dekoriert. Im ersten nachchristlichen Jahrhundert waren vor allem schwarz-wei&#223;e Mosaike beliebt, wobei geometrische Motive dominieren. Fig&#252;rliche Darstellungen sind eher selten und werden erst im zweiten Jahrhundert beliebter. Seit dem zweiten Jahrhundert kommen auch wieder mehrfarbige Mosaike vor, die vor allem in den afrikanischen Provinzen besonders beliebt waren und einen eigenen Stil zeigen. Im Osten des Reiches herrschen klassisch griechische Stilelemente und Traditionen vor. Die Mosaikkunst wurde vor allem im Byzantinischen Reich betrieben. Bekannte sp&#228;tantike Mosaike befinden sich auch im italienischen Ravenna.</German>

The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th century. The most important pieces are the Circus Scene, the 64 m long Great Hunting Scene, the Little Hunt, the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls, showing women exercising in modern-looking bikinis. The peristyle, the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics. Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in Palermo where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus, Alexander the Greats Hunt and the Four Seasons.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Un mosaico (del lat&#237;n mosaicum [opus], [obra] relativa a las Musas, art&#237;stica) es una obra pict&#243;rica elaborada con peque&#241;as piezas de piedra, cer&#225;mica, vidrio u otros materiales similares de diversas formas y colores, llamadas teselas, unidas mediante yeso, u otro aglomerante, para formar composiciones decorativas geom&#233;tricas o figurativas. Cuando las piezas empleadas son de madera se denomina taracea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se observa en los yacimientos de la ciudad asiria llamada N&#237;nive. Se ha podido ver que decoraban las paredes y las columnas con peque&#241;os trozos de arcilla de colores conformando dise&#241;os geom&#233;tricos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La t&#233;cnica del mosaico proviene de un perfeccionamiento del primitivo pavimento que se hac&#237;a con guijarros y se denominaba con el t&#233;rmino griego de lithostrotos ("preparado con piedras").En el mundo europeo fue muy frecuente y desde muy temprano (desde fines del siglo V a. C.) el pavimento compuesto por guijas de r&#237;o (piedrecillas peque&#241;as que se encuentran en las orillas) de tama&#241;os y de colores distintos. Con estas guijas se hac&#237;an dibujos sencillos de temas geom&#233;tricos. En los pueblos de Castilla y Le&#243;n (en Espa&#241;a) han seguido a trav&#233;s de los siglos esta tradici&#243;n para los patios y zaguanes de las casas. Es lo que llaman enguijarrado.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Este sistema de pavimentaci&#243;n se ha podido ver claramente en las casas de Olinto (Olynthos), antigua ciudad griega de la regi&#243;n de Macedonia en la pen&#237;nsula Calc&#237;dica, que fue destruida por Filipo II de Macedonia en el a&#241;o 348 a. C., y en las ciudades de Pella y Corinto. Las escenas representadas con estos guijarros suelen ser del mundo marino, del repertorio hom&#233;rico y del culto a Dioniso.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Todos los pueblos antiguos hicieron incursi&#243;n en este arte tanto en la antig&#252;edad cl&#225;sica como en la de Mesoam&#233;rica. En la antig&#252;edad cl&#225;sica lleg&#243; a ser un producto muy elaborado y de gran lujo con la cultura helen&#237;stica, en que se empezaron a realizar obras m&#225;s complicadas con temas complejos y episodios de la vida cotidiana y de la mitolog&#237;a. Los materiales empleados tambi&#233;n fueron m&#225;s ricos (m&#225;rmol, vidrio, &#243;nice). El arte del mosaico adquiere su difusi&#243;n en &#233;poca del Imperio romano.</Spanish>

		<English>Parchment is a thin material made from calfskin, sheepskin or goatskin, often split. Its most common use was as a material for writing on, for documents, notes, or the pages of a book, codex or manuscript. It is distinct from leather in that parchment is limed but not tanned; therefore, it is very reactive to changes in relative humidity and is not waterproof. The finer qualities of parchment are called vellum. According to the Roman Varro, Plinys Natural History records that parchment was invented under the patronage of Eumenes of Pergamum, as a substitute for papyrus, which was temporarily not being exported from Alexandria, its only source. Herodotus mentions writing on skins as common in his time, the 5th century BC; and in his Histories he states that the Ionians of Asia Minor had been accustomed to give the name of skins (diphtherai) to books; this word was adapted by Hellenized Jews to describe scrolls. Parchment (pergamenum in Latin), however, derives its name from Pergamon, the city where it was perfected (via the French parchemin). In the 2nd century B.C. a great library was set up in Pergamon that rivalled the famous Library of Alexandria. As prices rose for papyrus and the reed used for making it was over-harvested towards local extinction in the two nomes of the Nile delta that produced it, Pergamon adapted by increasing use of parchment. Writing on prepared animal skins had a long history, however. Some Egyptian Fourth Dynasty texts were written on parchment. Though the Assyrians and the Babylonians impressed their cuneiform on clay tablets, they also wrote on parchment from the 6th century BC onward. Rabbinic culture equated the idea of a book with a parchment scroll. Early Islamic texts are also found on parchment.</English>

		<German>Pergament ist eine leicht bearbeitete Tierhaut, die seit dem Altertum als Beschreibstoff verwendet worden ist. In den Hochkulturen des Alten Orients und des Mittelmeerraumes wurde seit altersher Leder als Beschreibstoff verwendet. Wie Leder wird auch Pergament aus Tierh&#228;uten hergestellt, die man allerdings ungegerbt in eine Kalkl&#246;sung legt, bevor Haare, Oberhaut und anhaftende Fleischreste abgeschabt werden. Anschlie&#223;end wird die Haut gereinigt, gespannt und getrocknet. Die Oberfl&#228;che wird mit Bimsstein gegl&#228;ttet und mit Kreide gewei&#223;t. Je nach Sorgfalt der Bearbeitung bleibt die unterschiedliche Oberfl&#228;chenstruktur von Fleisch- und Haarseite deutlicher oder weniger deutlich erhalten: die Fleischseite ist glatt, die Haarseite zeigt die Poren. Die feinste Qualit&#228;t wurde aus H&#228;uten neugeborener oder ungeborener Ziegen und L&#228;mmer hergestellt. Die Vorz&#252;ge des Pergaments gegen&#252;ber dem Papyrus bestanden in seiner glatteren Oberfl&#228;che, in seiner Festigkeit und Dauerhaftigkeit sowie auch in seiner hellen Farbe. Die gute Tilgbarkeit der Beschriftung erleichtert die Wiederverwendung bereits beschriebenen Pergaments. In diesem Fall spricht man von einem Palimpsest (griech. palimpsestos: wieder abgekratzt) oder einem codex rescriptus (lat.: wiederbeschriebener Kodex). Die Qualit&#228;t des Pergaments und die Sorgfalt bei der Herstellung waren ein Ma&#223;stab f&#252;r das Niveau eines Skriptoriums. Das K&#246;nnen der Schreiber und der Maler zeigte sich im Umgang mit dem &#228;u&#223;erst feuchtigkeitsempfindlichen Beschreibstoff. Auch daf&#252;r haben sich Empfehlungen &#252;berliefert, beispielsweise in der anonymen Handschrift Compendium artis picturae des 12. Jahrhunderts. Der Richtwert f&#252;r die Aufbewahrung von Pergament ist eine konstante Luftfeuchtigkeit von nicht unter 40 % bei Temperaturen um 20 C. Die Bezeichnung Pergament (griech. pergamene) leitet sich von dem Ortsnamen Pergamon (an der Westk&#252;ste der T&#252;rkei, heute Bergama) ab: griech. membrana pergamena bedeutet pergamenische H&#228;ute. Nach einer Notiz des &#228;lteren Plinius h&#228;tte der in &#196;gypten herrschende K&#246;nig Ptolemaios (offenbar Ptolemaios VI., 180 bis 145 v. Chr.) den Papyrusexport nach Pergamon verboten, wo K&#246;nig Eumenes II. (197 bis 159 v. Chr.) eine mit dem &#228;gyptischen Alexandria konkurrierende Bibliothek betrieb; gewisserma&#223;en aus Not h&#228;tten daraufhin die Pergamener das Pergament erfunden. Die Geschichte gilt heute weithin als legend&#228;r. Es wird vermutet, dass in Pergamon lediglich eine qualitative Verbesserung des Beschreibstoffs entwickelt wurde, auf welche die Namengebung zur&#252;ckgeht. Die &#228;ltesten datierbaren Dokumente griechischer Sprache auf Pergament stammen aus dem 2. Jh. v. Chr. Im 1. Jh. n. Chr. ist Pergament als Tr&#228;ger literarischer Werke indirekt bezeugt, datierbare Originale reichen bis in das 2. Jh. n. Chr. zur&#252;ck. Seit dem 4. Jh. n. Chr. begann man, Papyrusrollen in Pergamentkodices umzuschreiben, denen als Buchform die Zukunft geh&#246;ren sollte. Pergamentkodices sind die gro&#223;en Meisterwerke der sp&#228;tantiken Buchmalerei wie der Wiener Dioskurides oder der Vergilius Vaticanus. Weitere Zeugnisse des sp&#228;tantiken B&#252;cherluxus sind die sogenannten Purpurhandschriften, deren Pergamentseiten mit Purpur eingef&#228;rbt und mit Silber- oder Goldtinte beschrieben sind, wie z. B. die ebenfalls illuminierte Wiener Genesis. Als ein besonders kostbares Dokument auf sogenanntem Purpurpergament gilt die Heiratsurkunde der Kaiserin Theophanu aus dem 10. Jahrhundert, deren F&#228;rbung durch Mennige und F&#228;rberkrapp erreicht wurde. Da Pergament lichtdurchl&#228;ssig ist, wurden auch Lampen und Fenster mit Pergament verkleidet. Pergament diente daneben auch zur Verst&#228;rkung von Holzoberfl&#228;chen. So wurden seit der Antike Holzschilde u. a. mit Pergament beklebt, um das Spalten des Holzes bei Hieben zu verhindern. Im Holzprothesenbau diente Pergament bis in die Gegenwart dazu, die hohlen Holzsch&#228;fte von Arm- und Beinprothesen zu verfestigen. Das spr&#246;de Pappelholz w&#228;re ohne den aufgeschrumpften Pergament&#252;berzug auf Dauer gerissen. Gegen Ende des Mittelalters wurde das Pergament zunehmend vom Papier verdr&#228;ngt.</German>

		<Spanish>Pergamino es un material hecho a partir de la piel de una res u otros animales, especialmente fabricado para poder escribir sobre &#233;l. La piel sigue un proceso de eliminaci&#243;n de la epidermis, de la hipodermis, dejando s&#243;lo la dermis , y de estiramiento, al final del cual se consiguen las hojas con las que se elabora un libro, una filacteria o los rollos que se conoc&#237;an de la Antig&#252;edad. El origen de su nombre es la ciudad de P&#233;rgamo, donde se cree que exist&#237;a una gran productividad de gran calidad, aunque realmente su existencia se remonta a una &#233;poca anterior a la ciudad de P&#233;rgamo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Desde la Antig&#252;edad se utiliz&#243; este material para escribir textos literarios, sagrados, etc. Con anterioridad al pergamino, se utilizaba el papiro que era un material m&#225;s fr&#225;gil e inc&#243;modo tanto para el copista como para el lector. El pergamino acab&#243; sustituyendo al papiro por sus ventajas materiales, por ser un soporte m&#225;s f&#225;cil de conseguir que el papiro, mucho m&#225;s duradero y de mejor calidad. P&#233;rgamo se convirti&#243; en la ciudad productora por excelencia, dando su nombre a este material. Los vol&#250;menes de la Biblioteca de P&#233;rgamo pasaron a copiarse en pergamino, en sustituci&#243;n del papiro. Una leyenda sin fundamento hist&#243;rico cuenta que este cambio fue debido a que la ciudad de Alejandr&#237;a, rival de la ciudad de P&#233;rgamo en cuanto a construcci&#243;n de bibliotecas y producci&#243;n de textos, dej&#243; de abastecer a Eumenes de material de papiro, material cuya distribuci&#243;n ten&#237;a monopolizada, pero lo cierto es que ya se ven&#237;a utilizando el pergamino en Egipto desde el ii milenio a.CPlantilla:Harvn, adem&#225;s de que tambi&#233;n en estas regiones de Asia se cultivaba el papiro.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El papiro y el pergamino convivieron durante bastantes a&#241;os. En rollos de papiro siguieron copi&#225;ndose los libros que fabricaban los talleres romanos, as&#237; como los documentos de archivo y las cartas, mientras que el pergamino se reservaba para obras de car&#225;cter subalterno o peque&#241;as composiciones literarias, como relata Marcial en sus Epigramas. El pergamino empez&#243; a utilizarse para copiar libros de buena factura cuando se difundi&#243; el nuevo formato de codex o c&#243;dice a partir del siglo IV de nuestra era.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aunque el la forma del libro llamada c&#243;dice fue conocida desde el siglo I, no se difundi&#243; hasta el siglo IV.

El propio nombre de c&#243;dice procede de la manera con la que se identificaban tales tablillas (codex) y los primeros c&#243;dices fueron conocidos como codex membranei.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A pesar de todo, en Roma naci&#243; enseguida una industria del pergamino que dio lugar a los comercios llamados tiendas de los membranarii.[NEWLINE]Una de las ventajas que el pergamino ten&#237;a sobre el papiro era que se pod&#237;a escribir en &#233;l por las dos caras de la piel, adem&#225;s se pod&#237;a raspar o lavar y reutilizar; aun as&#237; su alto coste hizo que no sustituyeran el uso de los rollos de papiro durante bastante tiempo.[NEWLINE]Entre los romanos, en los comienzos del siglo II, el pergamino era ya de uso corriente y fue en el periodo del Bajo Imperio cuando desplaz&#243; definitivamente al papiro que a&#250;n subsist&#237;a, pues era mucho m&#225;s barato y f&#225;cil de conseguir. En realidad los romanos no dejaron de utilizar el papiro despu&#233;s de la inclusi&#243;n del pergamino, sobre todo para escrituras que consideraban menos importantes, como cartas, algunos documentos, etc.</Spanish>

		<English>The corvus ("crow" in Latin) or harpago (probably the correct ancient name) was a Roman military boarding device used in naval warfare during the First Punic War against Carthage. In Chapters 1.22-4-11 of his History, Polybius describes this device as a bridge 1.2 m (4 ft) wide and 10.9 m (36 ft) long, with a small parapet on both sides. The engine was probably used in the prow of the ship, where a system of pulleys and a pole allowed the bridge to be raised and lowered. There was a heavy spike shaped as a birds beak on the underside of the device. The spike was designed to pierce the enemy ships deck when the boarding-bridge was lowered. This allowed a firm grip between the vessels and a route for the legionaries to cross to the other ship. In the 3rd century BC, Rome was not a naval power and had little or no experience in war at sea. Before the first Punic war, the Roman Republic had not campaigned outside the Italian Peninsula. The Republics military strength was on land, and her greatest assets were the discipline and courage of her soldiers. The boarding-bridge allowed her to use her marines against the superior Carthaginian naval skills. The Romans application of boarding tactics worked; they won several battles, most notably those of Mylae, Sulci, Tyndaris, and Ecnomus. Despite its advantages, the boarding bridge had serious drawbacks: it could not be used in rough seas since the stable connection of two working ships endangered each others structure. Operating in rough seas, the device became useless and was abandoned. According to Bonebaker, Professor of Naval Architecture at Delft, with the estimated weight of one ton for the boarding bridge, it is "most improbable that the stability of a quinquereme with a displacement of about 250m would be seriously upset". Some other historians believe that its weight on the prow compromised the ships navigability and the Romans lost almost two entire fleets to storms in 255 and in 249 BC, largely due to the instability caused by the device. These losses were probably the main reason for the abandonment of the boarding-bridge in ship design by the end of the war. As Roman naval tactics improved and the Roman crews became more experienced, the boarding-bridge was no longer used in battle. It is not mentioned in period sources after the battle of Ecnomus and apparently the Battle of the Aegates Islands that decided the first Punic war was won without it.</English>
		<French>Le corvus ("corbeau" en latin) ou harpago (probablement le nom ancien correct) &#233;tait un dispositif d'arraisonnement militaire romain utilis&#233; dans la guerre navale pendant la premi&#232;re guerre punique contre Carthage. Dans les chapitres 1.22-4-11 de son histoire, Polybe d&#233;crit cet appareil comme un pont de 1,2 m (4 pi) de large et 10,9 m (36 pi) de long, avec un petit parapet des deux c&#244;t&#233;s. Le moteur &#233;tait probablement utilis&#233; dans la proue du navire, o&#249; un syst&#232;me de poulies et d'un poteau permettait de lever et d'abaisser le pont. Il y avait une lourde pointe en forme de bec d'oiseau sous l'appareil. La pointe &#233;tait con&#231;ue pour percer le pont des navires ennemis lorsque la passerelle d'embarquement &#233;tait abaiss&#233;e. Cela a permis une prise ferme entre les navires et une route pour les l&#233;gionnaires &#224; traverser vers l'autre navire. Au 3&#232;me si&#232;cle avant JC, Rome n'&#233;tait pas une puissance navale et avait peu ou pas d'exp&#233;rience de la guerre en mer. Avant la premi&#232;re guerre punique, la R&#233;publique romaine n'avait pas fait campagne en dehors de la p&#233;ninsule italienne. La force militaire de la R&#233;publique &#233;tait sur terre, et ses plus grands atouts &#233;taient la discipline et le courage de ses soldats. Le pont d'embarquement lui a permis d'utiliser ses marines contre les comp&#233;tences navales carthaginoises sup&#233;rieures. L'application des tactiques d'abordage par les Romains a fonctionn&#233; ; ils ont remport&#233; plusieurs batailles, notamment celles de Mylae, Sulci, Tyndaris et Ecnomus. Malgr&#233; ses avantages, la passerelle d'embarquement pr&#233;sentait de s&#233;rieux inconv&#233;nients : elle ne pouvait pas &#234;tre utilis&#233;e par mer agit&#233;e car la connexion stable de deux navires de travail mettait en danger la structure de l'autre. Fonctionnant par mer agit&#233;e, l'appareil est devenu inutile et a &#233;t&#233; abandonn&#233;. Selon Bonebaker, professeur d'architecture navale &#224; Delft, avec le poids estim&#233; d'une tonne pour le pont d'embarquement, il est "le plus improbable que la stabilit&#233; d'un quinquer&#232;me avec un d&#233;placement d'environ 250m soit s&#233;rieusement boulevers&#233;e". Certains autres historiens pensent que son poids sur la proue a compromis la navigabilit&#233; des navires et les Romains ont perdu presque deux flottes enti&#232;res lors de temp&#234;tes en 255 et en 249 avant JC, en grande partie &#224; cause de l'instabilit&#233; caus&#233;e par l'appareil. Ces pertes &#233;taient probablement la principale raison de l'abandon de la passerelle d'embarquement dans la conception des navires &#224; la fin de la guerre. &#192; mesure que les tactiques navales romaines s'am&#233;lioraient et que les &#233;quipages romains devenaient plus exp&#233;riment&#233;s, la passerelle d'embarquement n'&#233;tait plus utilis&#233;e au combat. Il n'est pas mentionn&#233; dans les sources d'&#233;poque apr&#232;s la bataille d'Ecnomus et apparemment la bataille des &#238;les Aegates qui a d&#233;cid&#233; que la premi&#232;re guerre punique a &#233;t&#233; gagn&#233;e sans elle.</French>
		<German>Im Seekampf gegen die auf See &#252;berm&#228;chtige Macht Karthago musste Rom zum ersten mal in seine Geschichte eine gro&#223;e Flotte aufstellen. Zwar stellten die griechischen Verb&#252;ndeten gro&#223;e Kontingente auf, doch um es mit der Flotte Karthagos aufzunehmen bedurfte es mehr Schiffe und bessere Taktiken. Trotz gro&#223;er Bem&#252;hungen und hoher Anzahl neu gebauter Schiffe, konnte Rom sich nicht wirklich durchsetzen und sie konnten gegen die erfahrenen Admir&#228;le der Karthager keine wichtigen Erfolge verbuchen. Deshalb st&#252;tzen sie sich auf eine neue Erfindung: der Corvus, oder die Enterbr&#252;cke. Auf dem Vorderdeck jedes Schiffes wurde ein etwa acht Meter hoher Pfahl montiert, an dessen Fu&#223; eine etwa zw&#246;lf Meter lange Holzbr&#252;cke so befestigt war, dass sie sich um den Pfahl in jede beliebige Richtung drehen lie&#223;. Am &#228;u&#223;eren Ende war die Br&#252;cke mit einem abw&#228;rtsgerichteten Eisensporn versehen. Wenn ein Schiff nun in die N&#228;he kam, lie&#223; man die Br&#252;cke auf das gegnerische Schiff hinunter und verwickelte die gegnerische Mannschafft in den Nahkampf, in dem die R&#246;mer eindeutig &#252;berlegen waren. Schon kurze Zeit nach der Vernichtung Karthagos wurde der Corvus jedoch abgeschafft, da er die Schiffe langsamer, unbeweglicher und instabiler machte.</German>
		<Italian>Il corvus ("corvo" in latino) o harpago (probabilmente il nome antico corretto) era un dispositivo di imbarco militare romano utilizzato nella guerra navale durante la prima guerra punica contro Cartagine. Nei capitoli 1.22-4-11 della sua Storia, Polibio descrive questo dispositivo come un ponte largo 1,2 m (4 piedi) e lungo 10,9 m (36 piedi), con un piccolo parapetto su entrambi i lati. Il motore era probabilmente utilizzato nella prua della nave, dove un sistema di carrucole e un palo permettevano di alzare e abbassare il ponte. C'era una punta pesante a forma di becco d'uccello sul lato inferiore del dispositivo. La punta era progettata per perforare il ponte delle navi nemiche quando il ponte d'imbarco veniva abbassato. Ci&#242; ha permesso una presa salda tra le navi e una rotta per i legionari per attraversare l'altra nave. Nel III secolo a.C., Roma non era una potenza navale e aveva poca o nessuna esperienza di guerra in mare. Prima della prima guerra punica, la Repubblica Romana non aveva condotto campagne al di fuori della penisola italiana. La forza militare della Repubblica era a terra e le sue pi&#249; grandi risorse erano la disciplina e il coraggio dei suoi soldati. Il ponte d'imbarco le ha permesso di usare i suoi marines contro le superiori abilit&#224; navali cartaginesi. L'applicazione romana delle tattiche di abbordaggio funzion&#242;; hanno vinto diverse battaglie, in particolare quelle di Mylae, Sulci, Tyndaris ed Ecnomus. Nonostante i suoi vantaggi, il ponte di imbarco presentava seri inconvenienti: non poteva essere utilizzato con mare formato poich&#233; il collegamento stabile di due navi da lavoro metteva in pericolo la struttura reciproca. Operando con mare mosso, il dispositivo &#232; diventato inutile ed &#232; stato abbandonato. Secondo Bonebaker, professore di architettura navale a Delft, con il peso stimato di una tonnellata per il ponte di imbarco, &#232; "molto improbabile che la stabilit&#224; di un quinquereme con un dislocamento di circa 250 m venga seriamente turbata". Alcuni altri storici ritengono che il suo peso sulla prua compromettesse la navigabilit&#224; delle navi e i romani persero quasi due intere flotte a causa di tempeste nel 255 e nel 249 aC, in gran parte a causa dell'instabilit&#224; causata dal dispositivo. Queste perdite furono probabilmente la ragione principale per l'abbandono del ponte d'imbarco nella progettazione della nave entro la fine della guerra. Man mano che le tattiche navali romane miglioravano e gli equipaggi romani diventavano pi&#249; esperti, il ponte d'imbarco non fu pi&#249; utilizzato in battaglia. Non &#232; menzionato nelle fonti d'epoca dopo la battaglia di Ecnomus e apparentemente la battaglia delle Isole Egadi che decise che la prima guerra punica fu vinta senza di essa.</Italian>
		<Spanish>El corvus era un arma de la marina de guerra romana destinada al abordaje. De origen griego, era una especie de garfio con que se enganchaba a los buques enemigos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seg&#250;n Polibio, el c&#243;nsul Cayo Duilio invent&#243; un artilugio parecido, un m&#225;stil de siete metros colocado en la proa del buque un poco inclinado hacia el mar. Con dos roldanas, y por medio de un cabo que pasaba por la primera de estas, se pod&#237;a levantar o bajar una especie de puente levadizo que se mov&#237;a de arriba a abajo mediante el peque&#241;o m&#225;stil. &#201;ste estaba sujeto, y por la segunda roldana pasaba otro cabo a cuyo extremo iba atado un pesado pil&#243;n de hierro que ca&#237;a contra el buque enemigo, perforando la cubierta y sujet&#225;ndolo. Cuando el arp&#243;n o pil&#243;n encadenaba los buques de tal suerte que se tocaban sus costados, los soldados romanos saltaban como pod&#237;an al abordaje. Los primeros soldados en pasar a trav&#233;s de la pasarela colocaban sus escudos como protecci&#243;n a los lados de la barandilla. El resto de tropas pod&#237;an abordar el barco bajo resguardo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tras las Guerras P&#250;nicas y la batalla del Cabo Ecnomo (256 a. C.) ya nunca m&#225;s se volvi&#243; a utilizar este invento, dejando de ser mencionado en las fuentes cl&#225;sicas, debido principalmente a la mayor pericia en otras t&#233;cnicas de combate y a que restaba estabilidad a los barcos frente a tempestades.</Spanish>

		<English>Mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment. The discipline has its roots in several ancient civilizations. The ancient Greek philosophers, and Aristotle in particular, were among the first to propose that abstract principles govern nature. Aristotle argued, in On the Heavens, that terrestrial bodies rise or fall to their "natural place" and mistakenly claimed that an object twice as heavy as some other would fall to the ground from the same height, in half the time. Aristotle believed in logic and observation but it would be more than a thousand years before Francis Bacon would first develop the scientific method of experimentation, which he called a vexation of nature. Aristotle saw a distinction between "natural motion" and "forced motion", and he believed that in a hypothetical vacuum, there would be no reason for a body to move naturally toward one point rather than any other, and so he concluded a body in a vacuum must either stay at rest or else move indefinitely fast. In this way, Aristotle was the first to approach something similar to the law of inertia. However, he believed a vacuum would be impossible because the surrounding air would rush in to fill it immediately. He also believed that an object would stop moving in an unnatural direction once the applied forces were removed. Later Aristotelians developed an elaborate explanation for why an arrow continues to fly through the air after it has left the bow, proposing that an arrow creates a vacuum in its wake, into which air rushes, pushing it from behind. Aristotles beliefs were influenced by Platos teachings on the perfection of the circular uniform motions of the heavens. As a result, he conceived of a natural order in which the those motions were necessarily perfect, in contrast to the terrestrial world of changing elements, were individuals come to be and pass away.</English>

		<German>Die Mechanik ist ein Teilgebiet der Physik. Sie befasst sich mit der Bewegung von K&#246;rpern und der Einwirkung von Kr&#228;ften. Nach der Geometrie ist die Mechanik in der Menschheitsgeschichte der zweite Versuch, mit wissenschaftlichen Mitteln einen Teil der Welt zu verstehen und sie auch zu ver&#228;ndern. Man kann ihre Geschichte in zwei Perioden einteilen die 2000 Jahre von Aristoteles bis zu Newton und in die 200 Jahre danach bis zum Entstehen der Modernen Physik nach 1900 mit relativistischer Mechanik und Quantenmechanik. Nach ersten Spekulationen von Thales und anderen ionischen Naturphilosophen errichtete Aristoteles ein grandioses Gedankengeb&#228;ude, das alles zu erkl&#228;ren schien, aber leider zumindest in seinen physikalischen Aussagen v&#246;llig falsch war. Der Syrakuser Archimedes war dagegen viel konkreter und beobachtete sch&#228;rfer; er k&#246;nnte somit als wirklicher Vater der Mechanik gelten! [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Typisch f&#252;r die Griechen war ihr Interesse an den Prinzipien der Mechanik, konkrete Anwendungen besch&#228;ftigten sie dagegen weniger und dienten mehr der Unterhaltung. Ganz anders die praktisch denkenden R&#246;mer: ihr einziger Beitrag zur Mathematik und Mechanik war, wie es ein Wissenschaftshistoriker einmal ironisch formulierte, dass sie Archimedes erschlugen. Aber sie erbrachten erstaunliche Leistungen im Bau von Br&#252;cken, Gladiatorenarenen, Stra&#223;en und Wasser-leitungen. Mit dem Untergang der Antike und dem Sieg des Christentums, das die meisten B&#252;cher &#252;ber Mechanik und Mathematik als Zauberb&#252;cher zerst&#246;ren lie&#223;, begann eine tausendj&#228;hrige dunkle Epoche, nur einige wenige arabische (eigentlich persische oder andalusische) Mathematiker und Naturwissenschaftler sind erw&#228;hnenswert. Der Islam war in seiner Anfangszeit ausgesprochen wissenschaftsfreundlich und versuchte, die Ideen der alten Griechen weiterzuentwickeln und in seine Weltanschauung zu integrieren.</German>

		<English>Anatomy (from the Greek anatomia (separate, apart from), and temnein, (to cut up, cut open) is a branch of biology and medicine that is the consideration of the structure of living things. The development of anatomy as a science extends from the earliest examinations of sacrificial victims to the sophisticated analyses of the body performed by modern scientists. It has been characterized, over time, by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. Charaka, born c. 300 BC, was one of the principal contributors to the ancient art and science of Ayurveda, a system of medicine and lifestyle developed in Ancient India. He is referred to as the Father of Anatomy. The study of anatomy begins at least as early as 1600 BCE, the date of the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus. This treatise shows that the heart, its vessels, liver, spleen, kidneys, hypothalamus, uterus and bladder were recognized, and that the blood vessels were known to emanate from the heart. Other vessels are described, some carrying air, some mucus, and two to the right ear are said to carry the "breath of life", while two to the left ear the "breath of death". The Ebers papyrus (c. 1550 BCE) features a treatise on the heart. It notes that the heart is the center of the blood supply, with vessels attached for every member of the body. The Egyptians seem to have known little about the function of the kidneys and made the heart the meeting point of a number of vessels which carried all the fluids of the body blood, tears, urine and sperm. The earliest medical scientist of whose works any great part survives today is Hippocrates, a Greek physician active in the late 5th and early 4th centuries BCE (460-377 BCE). His work demonstrates a basic understanding of musculoskeletal structure, and the beginnings of understanding of the function of certain organs, such as the kidneys. Much of his work, however, and much of that of his students and followers later, relies on speculation rather than empirical observation of the body. One of the greatest achievements of Hippocrates was that he was the first to discover the tricuspid valve of the heart and its function which he documented in the treatise On the Heart in the Hippocratic Corpus. Later anatomists knew the function of the tricuspid valve after reading the Hippocratic Corpus. In the 4th century BCE, Aristotle and several contemporaries produced a more empirically founded system, based animal dissection. Around this time, Praxagoras is credited as the first to identify the difference between arteries and veins, and the relations between organs are described more accurately than in previous works. The first use of human cadavers for anatomical research occurred later in the 4th century BCE when Herophilos and Erasistratus gained permission to perform live dissections, or vivisection, on criminals in Alexandria under the auspices of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Herophilos in particular developed a body of anatomical knowledge much more informed by the actual structure of the human body than previous works had been.</English>

		<German>Die ersten anatomischen Zeugnisse findet man bereits in einigen Motiven der pr&#228;historischen H&#246;hlenmalerei. &#196;u&#223;erst erstaunlich ist, dass sich diese Menschen schon mit der Trepanation von Sch&#228;deln befasst haben, wobei wohl weder die Zeichnungen an den H&#246;hlenw&#228;nden noch die ge&#246;ffneten Sch&#228;del medizinische Ziele verfolgten. In der Antike entwickelte sich in der &#228;gyptischen Hafenstadt Alexandria ein Zentrum der Forschung und wissenschaftlichen Kultur. Dessen Infrastruktur zog K&#252;nstler und Wissenschaftler von weit her an, unter ihnen auch Claudius Galenus aus Pergamon. Er war ein herausragender Arzt und Anatom. Was ihn aber zum geschichtlichen Ph&#228;nomen macht, ist die Tatsache, dass es ihm gelang, den medizinischen Fortschritt f&#252;r Jahrhunderte zu blockieren. Wohl darf ihm als Verdienst angerechnet werden, das medizinische Wissen seiner Zeit systematisch zusammengestellt und in &#252;ber 400 Schriften dargestellt zu haben, selbst war er jedoch kein sch&#246;pferischer Forscher. Er wusste alles und wusste sich zu verkaufen. Sein gesamtes Werk ist voller Selbstlob und Polemik gegen andere &#196;rzte, und bis auf Hippokrates lie&#223; er niemanden neben sich gelten. Ganze dreizehn Jahrhunderte lang machte die Anatomie wie &#252;berhaupt die gesamte Medizin keine nennenswerten Fortschritte, man gab sich mit dem Kopieren alter Schriften, haupts&#228;chlich jener Galens, zufrieden. Erst in der Renaissance wurden diese Denkstrukturen von Einzelnen durchbrochen. Andreas Vesalius war es, der zur Emp&#246;rung seiner Kollegen die &#252;ber Jahrhunderte kaum hinterfragten Glaubenss&#228;tze erstmals wieder ersch&#252;ttern konnte. Seine Arbeit revolutionierte die Medizin seiner Zeit und macht ihn zum Begr&#252;nder der modernen Anatomie. Die Anatomie nahm einen hohen Stellenwert in den bildenden K&#252;nsten ein, Sektionen an Menschen und Tieren geh&#246;rten zur Grundausbildung der Studenten. K&#252;nstler wie Michelangelo, Raffael, D&#252;rer und da Vinci brachten Jahre mit dem Studium des menschlichen K&#246;rpers zu, wobei letzterer in seiner wissenschaftlichen Genauigkeit selbst den erst sp&#228;ter geborenen Vesalius &#252;bertraf. Die enge Zusammenarbeit von K&#252;nstlern und Anatomen lie&#223; medizinische Schriften von au&#223;ergew&#246;hnlich hoher Qualit&#228;t entstehen. Im Zeitalter der Aufkl&#228;rung errichtete man anatomische Theater, die neben dem wissenschaftlichen einen hohen Schauwert besa&#223;en.</German>

		<English>The runic alphabets are a set of related alphabets using letters known as runes to write various Germanic languages before the adoption of the Latin alphabet and for specialized purposes thereafter. The runes were in use among the Germanic peoples from the 1st or 2nd century AD. This period corresponds to the late Common Germanic stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries; North Germanic, West Germanic, and East Germanic. No distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for labiovelars in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the Anglo-Saxon futhorc and the Gothic alphabet as variants of p). The runes developed centuries after the Old Italic alphabets from which they are historically derived. The debate on the development of the runic script concerns the question which of the Italic alphabets should be taken as their point of origin, and which, if any, signs should be considered original innovations added to the letters found in the Italic scripts. The historical context of the scripts origin is the cultural contact between Germanic people, who often served as mercenaries in the Roman army, and the Italic peninsula during the Roman imperial period (1st c. BC to 5th c. AD).</English>

		<German>Runen k&#246;nnen einerseits als Zeichen f&#252;r jeweils einen Laut geschrieben werden (Alphabetschrift), andererseits als Zeichen stehen f&#252;r die jeweiligen Begriffe, deren Namen sie tragen. Daneben k&#246;nnen sie Zahlen darstellen oder als magisches Zeichen verwendet werden. Abgesehen von einer kurzen Phase im hochmittelalterlichen Skandinavien wurde die Runenschrift nicht zur Alltagskommunikation verwendet und die Zeichenformen entwickelten sich nicht ausgerichtet auf eine fl&#252;ssige Gebrauchsschriftlichkeit. Die Runen sind vermutlich weder unabh&#228;ngig entstanden, noch sind sie von den Germanen als fertiges Schriftsystem &#252;bernommen worden, sondern wurden weitgehend eigenst&#228;ndig nach Vorbildern s&#252;deurop&#228;ischer Schriften entwickelt. Sie treten allerdings schon sehr fr&#252;h als komplettes Alphabet mit 24 Buchstaben auf. Vor allem die lateinische Schrift, aber auch die zahlreichen vom Lateinischen verdr&#228;ngten und untergegangenen Schriften des keltisch-alpin-italischen Raums kommen als Vorbilder in Betracht. Runen gehen damit sowohl in ihrem Prinzip einer Buchstabenschrift als auch in der Form vieler Lautzeichen letztlich auf die gro&#223;e ph&#246;nizisch-aram&#228;ische Familie von Alphabeten zur&#252;ck, die im 1. Jahrtausend v. Chr. im Gebiet des Libanon und Syriens entstanden sind und zu denen auch alle heutigen europ&#228;ischen Schriften gez&#228;hlt werden. Der Ursprung der Runenschrift ist zeitlich und r&#228;umlich kaum zu erhellen, weil die &#228;ltesten Belege eben bereits einen etablierten Satz von Zeichen pr&#228;sentieren. Das erste gesicherte Auftreten von Runen, und zwar auf der Halbinsel J&#252;tland (s&#252;dlich bis ins heutige Schleswig-Holstein) sowie in Schweden, f&#228;llt in die zweite H&#228;lfte des 2. Jahrhunderts (Gegenst&#228;nde wie z. B. Waffen aus Mooropferpl&#228;tzen in J&#252;tland wie Vimose, Illerup dal, Nydam, Thorsberg). Vorstufen der Schrift, an denen ihre Entstehung nachzuvollziehen w&#228;re, konnten nicht zweifelsfrei identifiziert werden. Das &#228;u&#223;erliche Charakteristikum der Runen ist die Vermeidung waagrechter und gebogener Linien, was fr&#252;her immer wieder die Vermutung aufkommen lie&#223;, dass es sich um eine Buchstabenumformung handelt, die dazu geeignet sein sollte, vor allem in h&#246;lzernes Material geritzt zu werden. Man nahm folglich an, dass Vorstufen der Runen nur deshalb nicht bewahrt sind, weil ihr mutma&#223;licher Tr&#228;ger Holz sich schlechter als Metall erhalten hat. Neuere Funde (z. B. Moorfunde von Illerup dal, D&#228;nemark) zeigen jedoch auch gerundete Formen (z. B. bei der Odal-Rune) auf metallenen Waffenteilen.</German>
		<Italian>The runic alphabets are a set of related alphabets using letters known as runes to write various Germanic languages before the adoption of the Latin alphabet and for specialized purposes thereafter. The runes were in use among the Germanic peoples from the 1st or 2nd century AD. This period corresponds to the late Common Germanic stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries; North Germanic, West Germanic, and East Germanic. No distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for labiovelars in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the Anglo-Saxon futhorc and the Gothic alphabet as variants of p).

		<English>Shorthand is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases speed or brevity of writing as compared to a normal method of writing a language. The process of writing in shorthand is called stenography, from the Greek stenos (narrow) and graphe or graphie (writing). It has also been called brachygraphy, from Greek brachys (short) and tachygraphy, from Greek tachys (swift, speedy), depending on whether compression or speed of writing is the goal. The earliest known indication of shorthand systems is from Ancient Greece, namely the Parthenon in which a stone from mid-4th century BC was found. The marble slab shows a writing system primarily based on vowels, using certain modifications to indicate consonants. Hellenistic tachygraphy is reported from the 2nd century BC onwards, though there are indications that it might be older. The oldest datable reference is a contract from Middle Egypt, stating that Oxyrhynchos gives the "semeiographer" Apollonios for two years to be taught shorthand writing. Hellenistic tachygraphy consisted of word stem signs and word ending signs. Over time, many syllabic signs were developed. In Ancient Rome, Marcus Tullius Tiro (1034 BC), a slave and later a freedman of Cicero, developed the Tironian notes so he could write down Ciceros speeches. The Tironian notes consisted of Latin word stem abbreviations (notae) and of word ending abbreviations (titulae). The original Tironian notes consisted of about 4000 signs but new signs were introduced so that their number might increase to as many as 13,000. In order to have a less complex writing system, a syllabic shorthand script was sometimes used. After the decline of the Roman Empire, the Tironian notes were no longer used to transcribe speeches, though they were still known and taught, particularly during the Carolingian Renaissance. After the 11th century, however, they were mostly forgotten.</English>

		<German>Stenografie oder Stenographie, kurz Steno (Engschrift, Kurzschrift, Schnellschrift, Tachygraphie, Phonographie, Redezeichenkunst, Eilschrift) ist eine Schrift, die es erm&#246;glicht, in normalem Tempo gesprochene Sprache mitzuschreiben oder eigene Ideen schnell zu notieren. Mit Kurzschriftsystemen k&#246;nnen hohe Schreibgeschwindigkeiten erreicht werden, da der sprachliche Informationsgehalt mit grafischen und linguistischen Mitteln verdichtet wird (K&#252;rzungstechnik, s. u.). Stenografiesysteme waren schon den antiken Griechen und R&#246;mern bekannt (Tironische Noten) und wurden bis ins Mittelalter als Akten- und Kanzleischrift genutzt. In der Neuzeit waren geometrische Kurzschriftsysteme seit Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts insbesondere in England und Frankreich weit verbreitet. Auch in Deutschland kannte man seit 1678 geometrische Kurzschriften. Da Silbenstruktur und Lauth&#228;ufigkeiten der Sprachen unterschiedlich sind, werden sprachspezifische Kurzschriften ben&#246;tigt.

		<English>Since the early history of domestication of the horse, it was noted that working animals were exposed to many conditions that created breakage or excessive hoof wear. Ancient people recognized the need for the walls (and sometimes the sole) of domestic horses hooves to have additional protection over and above any natural hardness. An early form of hoof protection was seen in ancient Asia, where horses hooves were wrapped in rawhide, leather or other materials for both therapeutic purposes and protection from wear. The nailed shoe was a relatively late invention. The ancient Greek horse trainer Xenophon mentioned nothing about horseshoes in his treatise on the care of military cavalry, nor did the Digesta Artis Veterinariae by Vegetius Renatus, written in AD 480, mention nailed-on shoes, though he accurately enumerated everything connected with an army forge in the time. There are early literary references in the Koran, circa AD 632, to "war-horses which strike fire, by dashing their hoofs against the stones" which, if taken literally, is an effect that could be obtained only by shod horses, as barefoot hooves striking stone do not create sparks. Because iron was a valuable commodity, and any worn out items were generally melted down and reused, it is difficult to locate clear archaeological evidence of the earliest horseshoes. From archaeological finds in Great Britain, it appears that the Romans attempted to protect their horses feet with a strap-on, solid-bottomed "hipposandal" that has a slight resemblance to the modern hoof boot.</English>

		<German>Schon in der Antike suchten die Menschen nach einem Schutz f&#252;r die Hufe, die von hartem, steinigem Boden stark abgenutzt werden. Besonders mit der milit&#228;rischen Nutzung des Pferdes wurde der Hufschutz zu einer Notwendigkeit, denn im Kriege wurden die Pferde &#252;ber ihre nat&#252;rlichen Grenzen hinweg beansprucht. Vorg&#228;nger der Hufeisen waren die sogenannten Hipposandalen. Im alten &#196;gypten wurden geflochtene Sandalen aus Bast oder Lederschuhe verwendet, die mit Stricken oder Riemen ans Pferdebein gebunden wurden. Allerdings waren solche Konstruktionen wenig haltbar. Die R&#246;mer verwendeten bereits Hufbeschlag aus Bronze oder Eisen, aber auch bei ihnen verursachten die Riemen Scheuerwunden. Bei schnellem Ritt flogen die gebundenen Eisen schnell weg oder die Pferde gerieten ins Straucheln. Genagelte Hufeisen, wie sie heute verwendet werden, scheinen von den Kelten erfunden worden zu sein; seit sp&#228;tkeltischer Zeit (2. oder 1. Jahrhundert v. Chr.) in Gebrauch, wurden sie von den R&#246;mern &#252;bernommen und modifiziert. Daneben benutzte man allgemein, aber auch zu besonderen Zwecken (z. B. in morastigem Gel&#228;nde) die erw&#228;hnten Hipposandalen. Zahlreicher werden die Funde aufgenagelter Hufeisen erst seit dem fr&#252;hen Mittelalter (um 600). Als weiteres Indiz zur Datierung von genagelten Hufeisen in der Antike wird oftmals der Hortfund von Neupotz angegeben. Die aktuelle Interpretation des Fundkomplexes betrachtet diesen als ein im Jahre 260 verloren gegangenes Beutegut eines heimkehrenden alemannischen Pl&#252;ndererzuges. Da bei der Bergung auch vorr&#246;mische und nachantike Fundst&#252;cke zu Tage traten, sind die gefundenen Hufeisen nicht eindeutig als r&#246;misch zu datieren. Viele Historiker datieren die Erfindung des genagelten Hufeisens ins fr&#252;he Mittelalter.</German>

		<English>The stirrup, which gives greater stability to a rider, has been described as one of the most significant inventions in the history of warfare, prior to gunpowder. As a tool allowing expanded use of horses in warfare, the stirrup is often called the third revolutionary step in equipment, after the chariot and the saddle. The basic tactics of mounted warfare were significantly altered by the stirrup. A rider supported by stirrups was less likely to fall off while fighting, and could deliver a blow with a weapon that more fully employed the weight and momentum of horse and rider. Among other advantages, stirrups provided greater balance and support to the rider, which allowed the knight to use a sword more efficiently without falling, especially against infantry adversaries. Contrary to common modern belief, however, stirrups actually did not enable the horseman to use a lance more effectively (cataphracts had used lances since antiquity), though the cantled saddle did. The invention of the stirrup occurred relatively late in history, considering that horses were domesticated in approximately 4500 BC, and the earliest forms of the saddle-a simple blanket with light padding and a surcingle appeared about 800 BC. The earliest manifestation of the stirrup was a toe loop that held the big toe and was used in India, possibly as early as 500 BC. This ancient foot support consisted of a looped rope for the big toe which was at the bottom of a saddle made of fibre or leather. Such a configuration was suitable for the warm climate of south and central India where people used to ride horses barefoot. A pair of megalithic double bent iron bars with curvature at each end, excavated in Junapani in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh have been regarded as stirrups although they could as well be something else.</English>

		<German>Steigb&#252;gel in Form von ledernen Schlaufen f&#252;r die F&#252;&#223;e wurden etwa im 3. Jahrhundert v. Chr. von den Skythen erstmals benutzt und erst sehr viel sp&#228;ter von anderen europ&#228;ischen V&#246;lkern. Griechen und Karthager kannten sie nicht, die R&#246;mer lernten sie erst in der ausgehenden Sp&#228;tantike kennen (s. u.). W&#228;hrend die Hunnen noch keinen Sattel mit Steigb&#252;gel kannten, war dieser den sp&#228;teren eurasischen Reiternomaden wie den Awaren bekannt. Die meisten Wissenschaftler vertreten die Ansicht, dass die Awaren den metallenen Steigb&#252;gel erfanden und ihn im sp&#228;teren 6. Jahrhundert n. Chr. als erste nach Europa brachten. Fast die einzigen bleibenden Spuren, welche die Awaren nach der Vernichtung ihres Reiches im Jahre 796 durch Karl den Gro&#223;en hinterlie&#223;en, waren eben jene Steigb&#252;gel. Die fr&#252;heste bekannte Erw&#228;hnung von Steigb&#252;geln in einer abendl&#228;ndischen Quelle findet sich im Strategikon des Maurikios, das um 600 entstand, als sich Ostr&#246;mer und Awaren heftige K&#228;mpfe lieferten. Die Perser und die Byzantiner/Ostr&#246;mer, sp&#228;ter auch viele germanische St&#228;mme erkannten den Wert der Steigb&#252;gel und nutzten sie fortan. Die schwere mittelalterliche Panzerreiterei w&#228;re ohne sie nicht denkbar gewesen. So werden Normannen zum Beispiel auf dem am Ende des 11. Jahrhunderts entstandenen Teppich von Bayeux mit Steigb&#252;geln dargestellt, wie sie in die Schlacht bei Hastings (1066) reiten. Dass die R&#246;mer den Steigb&#252;gel so rasch &#252;bernahmen, ist kein Zufall. Bereits Belisar, ein gro&#223;er Feldherr der Ostr&#246;mer, &#252;bernahm die besten Kriegsmethoden der erfolgreichen Nomadenst&#228;mme. Die kaiserlichen Panzerreiter seiner Zeit benutzten (ebenso wie die persischen) stabile S&#228;ttel, R&#252;stungen, die ihre Bewegungsfreiheit nicht einschr&#228;nkten, und eine Vielzahl an Waffen. Ihre Ausr&#252;stung und ihr Geschick beim Reiten machte sie &#252;beraus erfolgreich. Die Weiterentwicklungen der Steigb&#252;gel, die von gepanzerten Reitern (Ritter) im Mittelalter verwendet wurden, machten die Steigb&#252;gel zum Bestandteil der Schutzwaffen der Ritter. Wie bei allen Schutzwaffen wurde die Gestaltung dieser Steigb&#252;gel gem&#228;&#223; dem Einsatztzweck und "der zu erwartenden Bedrohung" jeweils angepasst, was zu zahlreichen Formen dieser historischen Steigb&#252;gel f&#252;hrte.</German>

		<English>The Marib (or Marib or Maarib Dam) blocks the Wadi Adhanah (also Dhana or Adhana) in the valley of Dhana in the Balaq Hills, Yemen. The current dam is close to the ruins of the Great Dam of Marib, dating from around the seventh century BC. It was one of the engineering wonders of the ancient world and a central part of the south Arabian civilization around Marib. The site of the great Dam of Marib (Sudd Marib) is upstream (south-west) of the ancient city of Marib, once the capital of the Kingdom of Sabaa, believed to be the kingdom of the legendary Queen of Sheba. The Kingdom of Sabaa was a prosperous trading nation, with control of the frankincense and spice routes in Arabia and Abyssinia. The Sabaens built the dam to capture the periodic monsoon rains which falls on the nearby mountains and so irrigate the land around the city. Recent archaeological findings suggest that simple earth dams and a canal network were constructed as far back as 2000 BC. The building of the first Marib dam began somewhere between 1750 BC and 1700 BC. The Makrib Ali Yanouf Bin Dhamar Ali (c. 790 BC) had his name carved into parts of the dam to mark the completion[NEWLINE]eparation of the dam. The dam was of packed earth, triangular in cross section, 580 m in length and 4 metres high. It ran between two groups of rocks on either side of the river and was linked to the rock with substantial stonework. The dams position allowed for a spillway and sluices between the northern end of the dam and the cliffs to the west. Around 500 BC the dam height was increased to 7 metres, the upstream slope (the water face) was reinforced with a cover of stones, and irrigation was extended to include the southern side as well as the northern side. After the end of the Kingdom of Sheba, possession of the dam came to the Himyarites in around 115 BC. They undertook a further reconstruction, creating a structure 14 metres high with extensive water works at both the northern and southern ends-with five spillway channels, two masonry-reinforced sluices, a settling pond, and a 1000 metre canal to a distribution tank. These extensive works were not actually finalised until 325 AD and allowed the irrigation of 25,000 acres (100 km). Despite the increases in height, the dam suffered numerous breaches (recorded major incidents occurred in 449, 450, 542 and 548) and the maintenance work became increasingly onerous; the last recorded repairs took place in 557. In 570 or 575, the dam was again overtopped, and this time left unrepaired. The final destruction of the dam is noted in the Quran and the consequent failure of the irrigation system provoked the migration of up to 50,000 people.</English>

		<Spanish>La historia de la construcci&#243;n de presas se remonta en la antig&#252;edad hasta las primeras civilizaciones del Medio Oriente y del Lejano Oriente. innumerables peque&#241;as presas, invariables estructuras de rellenos simples, se construyeron para irrigaci&#243;n, por ejemplo en China, Jap&#243;n, India y Sri Lanka. Algunas de estas primeras presas existen todav&#237;a. Las primeras civilizaciones construyeron un buen n&#250;mero de otras presas importantes en el Medio Oriente, tal es el caso de la presa de Marib, construida en Yemen, una de las grandes obras de ingenier&#237;a de la antig&#252;edad. Estuvo en funcionamiento durante m&#225;s de mil a&#241;os, y a&#250;n subsisten de ella impresionantes ruinas en el lugar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] La antigua ciudad de Marib era la capital del Reino De Saba'a, una naci&#243;n pr&#243;spera de comercio, con el control del incienso y las rutas de las especias entre Arabia y Abisinia. La presa se construy&#243; para captar las peri&#243;dicas lluvias de monz&#243;n que caen en las monta&#241;as cercanas y as&#237; regar la tierra alrededor de la ciudad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los &#250;ltimos resultados arqueol&#243;gicos sugieren que ya en el a&#241;o 2.000 A.C. fueron construidas simples presas de tierra y una red de canales. La construcci&#243;n de la presa de Marib comenz&#243; en alg&#250;n momento entre 1.750 y 1.700 A.C. La presa era de tierra apisonada, secci&#243;n transversal triagular, 4 metros de altura y 580 m de longitud. Funcion&#243; entre dos grupos de rocas a ambos lados del r&#237;o y estaba vinculado a la roca con importantes trabajos en piedra. La posici&#243;n de la presa permiti&#243; un vertedero y compuertas entre el extremo norte de la presa y el acantilado hacia el oeste. Alrededor de 500 A.C., la altura de la presa se &#8203;&#8203;aument&#243; a 7 metros, aguas arriba la pendiente (paramento aguas arriba) fue reforzada con una cubierta de piedras, y la irrigaci&#243;n se extendi&#243; a la parte sur, as&#237; como al lado norte.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tras el final del Reino de Saba, la posesi&#243;n de la presa pas&#243; a los himyaritas, alrededor del 115 A.C. Los que llevaron a cabo una nueva reconstrucci&#243;n, creando una estructura de mayor altura con extensas obras que no se finalizaron en realidad hasta el a&#241;o 325 D.C. y permitieron el riego de 100 km2.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La presa ten&#237;a una altura m&#225;xima de 20 metros, cerca de 700 metros de longitud y estaba formada por un simple terrapl&#233;n homog&#233;neo revestido en su paramento aguas arriba. Si importantes fueron sus dimensiones, m&#225;s lo eran las del aliviadero y estructura de toma. El aliviadero ten&#237;a 50 m de longitud y su umbral se situaba 3 m por encima de las tomas de agua y 4 por debajo de la coronaci&#243;n, creando un volumen de laminaci&#243;n de 30 hm3, extraordinario para la &#233;poca y que pone de manifiesto el conocimiento que sus constructores ten&#237;an acerca de los peligros del r&#237;o en el que se situaba. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A pesar de los incrementos en la altura, y de la capacidad de desag&#252;e de las tomas y aliviadero (1.500 m3/s), la presa sufri&#243; numerosas fallas (incidentes graves se produjeron en 449, 450, 542 y 548) y los trabajos de mantenimiento se hicieron cada vez m&#225;s onerosos, las &#250;ltima reparaci&#243;n grabada en piedra tuvo lugar en 557.

		<English>The first Roman fire brigade of which we have any substantial history was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Marcus Licinius Crassus was born into a wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through (in the words of Plutarch) "fire and rapine." One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigade-500 men strong-which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value. Augustus took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the Vigiles in AD 6 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire. Rome suffered a number of serious fires, most notably the fire that started near the Circus Maximus on 19 July AD 64 and eventually destroyed two thirds of Rome. Even today you can see the fire safety in the ancient marketplace of Trajan in Rome. The still partly preserved walls in front of the rotunda was built with a different material (volcanic stone) than the surrounding walls. It should have been the wall between the warehouses and the retail environment. These were fire safety measures which should be used again 2000 years later.</English>

Die tresviri nocturni bewachten anscheinend die Tore und Mauern der Stadt Rom und &#252;bernahmen auch die Brandwache. Die von ihnen befehligten Sklaven wurden zeitweise zum L&#246;schen eingesetzt. Genaueres ist &#252;ber die Truppe aber nicht bekannt. Von den r&#246;mischen Beamten waren die Aedilen f&#252;r die Brandbek&#228;mpfung zust&#228;ndig. Da diese Beamten nur f&#252;r ein Jahr im Amt waren, gab es keine M&#246;glichkeit f&#252;r eine kontinuierliche Organisation der Feuerwehr. Eine weitere Methode, Feuer zu l&#246;schen, betrieb unter anderem der Triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus. Er befehligte eine Truppe von mehr als 500 handwerklich begabten Sklaven. Diese Truppe r&#252;ckte bei Br&#228;nden an, und Crassus erbot sich, den brennenden Bau und das Gr&#252;ndst&#252;ck, sowie die gef&#228;hrdeten Nachbarh&#228;user zu kaufen. Dabei bot er nur einen Spottpreis. Waren die Eigent&#252;mer der brennenden H&#228;user mit dem Kaufpreis einverstanden, l&#246;schten die Sklaven des Cassius die Br&#228;nde. Dann wurden die Ruinen abgerissen und neue Geb&#228;ude errichtet. Ein lohnendes Gesch&#228;ft. Inwiefern auch andere diesem Gesch&#228;ftsprinzip nacheiferten, ist nicht &#252;berliefert. Die erste regul&#228;re Feuerwehr wurde von dem Aedil Egnatius Rufus gebildet. Zun&#228;chst finanzierte er die Einheit aus seinen eigenen Mitteln. Sp&#228;ter wurden ihm die Gelder erstattet. Die R&#246;mer wussten die Bem&#252;hungen des Beamten zu sch&#228;tzen. Der nutzte seine Beliebtheit in der Bev&#246;lkerung f&#252;r seine politische Karriere. Dies missfiel aber Augustus, der den unliebsamen Konkurrenten 19 v.Chr. hinrichten lie&#223;. Augustus sah aber die Notwendigkeit einer Feuerwehr ein und &#252;bertrug diese Aufgabe 23 v. Chr. den vici magistri. 600 Sklaven wurden nun als L&#246;schtruppe eingesetzt. Die Vigiles Diese Regelung galt bis ins Jahr 6 n. Chr. In diesem Jahr w&#252;teten so viele Br&#228;nde in der Stadt, dass sich Augustus zur Reorganisation der Feuerbek&#228;mpfung entschloss. Zun&#228;chst unterteilte er die Stadt in 14 regiones (Bezirke), die noch in weitere Untergliederungen aufgeteilt wurden. &#220;ber die Mannschaftsst&#228;rke liegen keine eindeutigen Zahlen vor. Es gibt Hinweise, dass die Feuerwehr zwischen 3500 bis 7000 Mann umfasste. Die Einheit wurde Vigiles genannt. Sie rekrutierte sich aus freigelassenen Sklaven. An der Spitze stand ein Tribun und ihm war der Kommandant, der praefectus vigilum, unterstellt. Die Vigilis wurde in sieben Kohorten aufgeteilt, die f&#252;r die &#220;berwachung von je zwei aneinander grenzenden regiones zust&#228;ndig waren. Stationiert waren die Kohorten in so genannten stationes und excubitoriae. Die Vigiles gingen vor allem nachts auf Streife, wobei sie die Brandschutzbestimungen, aber auch die T&#252;ren und Tore der H&#228;user &#252;berpr&#252;ften, ob diese auch verschlossen waren. Damit sollte den Einbr&#252;chen vorgebeugt werden. Augustus und Trajan &#252;berlie&#223;en dem Praefectus vigilum zum Teil die Rechtsprechung bei Brandstiftungsprozessen. Wurde die Brandbek&#228;mpfung in Rom vom Staat organisiert, verblieb diese Aufgabe im &#252;brigen Weltreich in privater Hand. In vielen St&#228;dten &#252;bernahmen Handwerksverb&#228;nde den Brandschutz und die Brandbek&#228;mpfung. Daneben wurden auch aus Freiwilligen zusammengesetzte L&#246;schtrupps gebildet, die zeitweise Wache hielten. Augustus stellte nicht nur die Feuerwehr auf, er erlie&#223; auch zahlreiche Bauvorschriften, die dem Brandschutz dienen sollten. Brandschutzmauern wurden errichtet, und &#246;ffentliche Geb&#228;ude durften keine gemeinsamen W&#228;nde mit anderen H&#228;usern haben. Au&#223;erdem wurden die Stra&#223;en erweitert, wenn es m&#246;glich war, und die H&#246;he der H&#228;user beschr&#228;nkt. Bei Trajan durften Geb&#228;ude nur 18 Meter hoch sein. Die Mieter in den insulae mussten Wasser und L&#246;schwerkzeug zur Brandbek&#228;mpfung vorr&#228;tig halten. Auch heute noch kann man den Brandschutz der Antike auf dem Trajansmarkt in Rom erkennen. Die noch zum Teil erhaltene Mauer vor dem Rundbau wurde aus einem anderen Material (Vulkanstein) als die umliegenden W&#228;nde erbaut. Sie soll die Zwischenwand zwischen den Lagerr&#228;umen und dem Verkaufsbereich gewesen sein. Das waren brandschutztechnische Ma&#223;nahmen, die erst 2000 Jahre sp&#228;ter wieder ihre Verwendung finden sollten.</German>
		<Italian>The first Roman fire brigade of which we have any substantial history was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Marcus Licinius Crassus was born into a wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through (in the words of Plutarch) "fire and rapine." One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigade-500 men strong-which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value. Augustus took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the Vigiles in AD 6 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire. Rome suffered a number of serious fires, most notably the fire that started near the Circus Maximus on 19 July AD 64 and eventually destroyed two thirds of Rome. Even today you can see the fire safety in the ancient marketplace of Trajan in Rome. The still partly preserved walls in front of the rotunda was built with a different material (volcanic stone) than the surrounding walls. It should have been the wall between the warehouses and the retail environment. These were fire safety measures which should be used again 2000 years later.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Bombero es la persona que se dedica a extinguir incendios, tradicionalmente mediante bombas hidr&#225;ulicas, que se utilizaban para sacar agua de pozos, r&#237;os o cualquier otro dep&#243;sito cercano al lugar del siniestro. Se atribuye al emperador C&#233;sar Augusto la creaci&#243;n del primer cuerpo de bomberos en Roma.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hay muchas evidencias hist&#243;ricas de acciones de grupos de personas organizados contra incendios, pero las pruebas m&#225;s antiguas de lo que podemos comparar con un cuerpo de bomberos actual aparecen con los romanos. En 2004, unos arque&#243;logos alemanes, bajo la direcci&#243;n de Bernd Paeffgen, descubrieron en el Valle del Rin, lo que fue descrito como una bomba de agua de 1650 a&#241;os de antig&#252;edad. El equipo contaba adem&#225;s con un tubo delgado de 1,10 metros que iba unido a la bomba. Inicialmente confundida con una lanza, las pruebas posteriores revelaron que se trataba de un conducto o manguera.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la antigua Roma, en la &#233;poca de Julio C&#233;sar, Marco Licinio Craso era una de las personas m&#225;s ricas de la ciudad; su riqueza proven&#237;a de los bienes ra&#237;ces y el alquiler inmobiliario, pero la historia curiosa le atribuye el m&#233;rito de haber sido el organizador del primer servicio contra incendios de Roma. Para asegurar que sus bomberos tuvieran siempre trabajo, tambi&#233;n organiz&#243; las primeras brigadas de incendiarios de las que se tiene referencias en la Historia. Pero estos curiosos bomberos eran controlados por Craso, que ambicioso y cruel, no daba orden de apagar el incendio si el due&#241;o del territorio o construcci&#243;n no lo vend&#237;a a precio de renta en ese instante. As&#237;, la gente prefer&#237;a ganar el dinero de la venta injustamente, que quedarse una casa o parcela devastados</Spanish>

		<Spanish>En la &#233;poca final de la Rep&#250;blica, los piratas en el Mediterr&#225;neo llegaron a convertirse en un peligro, desde sus bases primero al sur de Asia Menor en las monta&#241;osas costas de Cilicia y m&#225;s tarde por todo el Mediterr&#225;neo, puesto que[NEWLINE]imped&#237;an el comercio e interrump&#237;an las l&#237;neas de suministro de Roma.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A diferencia de siglos posteriores, los piratas de la Antig&#252;edad no buscaban tanto joyas y metales preciosos como personas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las sociedades de aquella &#233;poca sol&#237;an ser en su mayor&#237;a esclavistas, y la captura de personas para ser vendidas como esclavos resultaba una pr&#225;ctica altamente lucrativa.Pero tambi&#233;n se buscaban piedras preciosas, metales preciosos, esencias, telas, sal, tintes, vino y otros tipos de mercanc&#237;as que sol&#237;an transportarse en los barcos mercantes, caso de los fenicios.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Uno de los casos m&#225;s conocidos de pirater&#237;a contra las l&#237;neas de navegaci&#243;n lo protagoniz&#243; Julio C&#233;sar, que lleg&#243; a ser prisionero de los piratas cilicios (75 a.

Si conocieras tu negocio, sabr&#237;as que valgo por lo menos[NEWLINE]50. El cautiverio dur&#243; 38 d&#237;as, en los cuales el reh&#233;n amenaz&#243; a sus captores con crucificarlos.

En el 67 a. C., el senado romano nombr&#243; a Pompeyo proc&#243;nsul de los mares, lo que significaba que se le otorg&#243; el mando supremo del Mare Nostrum (el Mar Mediterr&#225;neo) y de sus costas hasta 75 km mar adentro. Se le[NEWLINE]concedieron todos los ej&#233;rcitos que se encontrasen a las costas del Mediterr&#225;neo, contando as&#237; con unos 150.000 efectivos, as&#237; como el derecho de tomar del tesoro la cantidad que necesitase.

Envanecidos por sus &#233;xitos, los piratas luc&#237;an en sus barcos astiles dorados de popa, cortinas de p&#250;rpura y remos con ramas plateadas.

C.), el C&#243;dice de Eshnunna (ca. 1930 a. C.) y el C&#243;dice de Lipit-Ishtar de Is&#237;n (ca. 1870 a. C.). Ellos tambi&#233;n crearon leyes como la 205 que se&#241;alaba que si el esclavo golpeaba en la mejilla al hijo de un hombre libre, deber&#237;an cortarle una oreja.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A menudo se lo se&#241;ala como el primer ejemplo del concepto jur&#237;dico de que algunas leyes son tan fundamentales que ni un rey tiene la capacidad de cambiarlas. Las leyes, escritas en piedra, eran inmutables. Este concepto pervive en la mayor&#237;a de los sistemas jur&#237;dicos modernos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Estas leyes, al igual que sucede con casi todos los c&#243;digos en la Antig&#252;edad, son consideradas de origen divino, como representa la imagen tallada en lo alto de la estela, donde el dios Shamash, el dios de la Justicia, entrega las leyes al rey Hammurabi. De hecho, anteriormente la administraci&#243;n de justicia reca&#237;a en los sacerdotes, que a partir de Hammurabi pierden este poder.

		<English>The Royal Library of Ashurbanipal, named after Ashurbanipal, the last great king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, is a collection of thousands of clay tablets and fragments containing texts of all kinds from the 7th century BC. Among its holdings was the famous Epic of Gilgamesh. Due to the sloppy handling of the original material much of the library is irreparably jumbled, making it impossible for scholars to discern and reconstruct many of the original texts, although some have survived intact.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The materials were found in the archaeological site of Kouyunjik (then ancient Nineveh, capital of Assyria) in northern Mesopotamia. The site is in modern day Iraq.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ashurbanipal was literate, and a passionate collector of texts and tablets. He sent scribes into every region of the Neo-Assyrian Empire to collect ancient texts. He hired scholars and scribes to copy texts, mainly from Babylonian sources.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ashurbanipal was not above using war booty as a means of stocking his library. Because he was known for being a scholar and being cruel to his enemies Ashurbanipal was able to use threats to gain materials from Babylonia and surrounding areas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The fragments from the royal library include royal inscriptions, chronicles, mythological and religious texts, contracts, royal grants and decrees, royal letters, and various administrative documents. Some of the texts contain divinations, omens, incantations and hymns to various gods, others relate to medicine, astronomy, and literature.</English>

		<German>Die &#252;ber 25.000 Tontafeln umfassende Bibliothek des Assurbanipal in Ninive war einst die gr&#246;&#223;te Schriftsammlung des Alten Orients und geh&#246;rt zu den bedeutendsten Funden der Assyriologie, aus der man ein immenses Wissen &#252;ber die Kulturen des alten Mesopotamien sch&#246;pfen konnte und die einen gro&#223;en Beitrag zur Entzifferung der Keilschrift lieferte.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Assurbanipal brachte eine Bibliothek zusammen, die das gesamte Wissen der damaligen Zeit repr&#228;sentierte. Dieses Wissen war jedoch stark von der Magie, von dunklem Glauben und vom Zauber bestimmt, was bedeutet, dass der gr&#246;&#223;te Teil der Bibliothek durch Werke der Beschw&#246;rungs-, Omen- und Ritualwissenschaft gef&#252;llt war. So trug der reiche Bestand an medizinischen Werken einen starken medizinisch-zauberischen Charakter. Ebenfalls befanden sich in dieser antiken Bibliothek eine Vielzahl an Werken der Mathematik, Philosophie und der Philologie.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ihre Entstehung geht direkt auf den neuassyrischen K&#246;nigs Assurbanipal zur&#252;ck, sein Interesse an geschriebenen Texten lie&#223; ihn die Tontafelsammlung in seinem Palast anlegen. Schon seine Vorg&#228;nger Tiglat-pileser I. und Sargon II. legten kleine Palastbibliotheken an, doch keiner entfaltete einen solchen Sammeleifer wie Assurbanipal. Es wurden Schreiber in die verschiedenen Teile des Reiches entsandt, um dort Abschriften von allen Texten anzufertigen oder Assurbanipal bestellte von den gr&#246;&#223;eren Archiven der Tempel (z. B. in Babylon) Abschriften, welche die Priester dann anfertigten und nach Ninive schickten. Manchmal lie&#223; er jedoch auf seinen Feldz&#252;gen auch ganze Tontafelsammlungen beschlagnahmen und in seine Hauptstadt verschleppen. Stets war er auf die Erweiterung seiner Bibliothek bedacht.</German>

		<Spanish>La biblioteca de Asurbanipal fue una gran biblioteca en la ciudad asiria de N&#237;nive, iniciada por el rey Sarg&#243;n II, que rein&#243; desde el 722 al 705 a. C. y ampliada por el rey Asurbanipal (669-627 a. C.). Se encontraba situada en el recinto del palacio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La biblioteca consist&#237;a en una colecci&#243;n de tablas hechas de arcilla, cubiertas de una escritura fina y apretada por ambos lados. Se llegaron a reunir hasta 22.000 tablillas, encontradas bajo los escombros del palacio real en N&#237;nive. Fue famosa y muy considerada desde su creaci&#243;n. Cuando los babilonios arrasaron N&#237;nive al mando de Nabopolasar en el 612 a. C., destruyeron gran parte de su contenido.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se trata de la colecci&#243;n m&#225;s completa que se conoce de escritura cuneiforme, un legado cultural dejado por el rey Asurbanipal que, seg&#250;n las noticias escritas que se conservan sobre su vida, mostr&#243; un gran inter&#233;s por el saber y la ciencia de Mesopotamia y dio orden de buscar y confiscar todas las tablillas posibles, sobre todo en Babilonia. En ellas puede encontrase los temas m&#225;s diversos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Una de las obras m&#225;s famosas de la biblioteca es el Poema de Gilgamesh, considerada como la obra narrativa m&#225;s antigua de la humanidad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El rey Asurbanipal fue educado como un pr&#237;ncipe cuyo destino, en principio, no ser&#237;a el de reinar, sino el de sacerdote o alg&#250;n otro cargo importante de la corte. Fue educado en las artes y las ciencias. Fue un rey guerrero y culto. &#201;l mismo escribe de su formaci&#243;n: [...he le&#237;do intrincadas tablillas inscritas en los oscuros sumerio y acadio, dif&#237;ciles de desentra&#241;ar...]...[...estudi&#233; el saber secreto de todo arte del escriba...].</Spanish>

		<English>The agoge was the rigorous education and training regimen mandated for all male Spartan citizens, except for the firstborn son in the ruling houses, Eurypontid and Agiad. The training involved learning stealth, cultivating loyalty to one's group, military training (e.g. pain tolerance), hunting, dancing, singing, and social preparation. The word "agoge" had in ancient Greek many meanings, among them seizure or abduction, but in this context generally meant leading, guidance or training.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to folklore agoge was introduced by the semi-mythical Spartan law-giver Lycurgus but its origins are thought to be between the 7th and 6th centuries BC when the state trained male citizens from the ages of seven to twenty-one.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The aim of the system was to produce physically and morally strong males to serve in the Spartan army. It encouraged conformity and the importance of the Spartan state over one's personal interest and generated the future elites of Sparta. The men would become the "walls of Sparta" because Sparta was the only Greek city with no defensive walls after they had been demolished at the order of Lycurgus. Discipline was strict and the males were encouraged to fight amongst themselves to determine the strongest member of the group.</English>

		<German>Als die Agoge wird das durch seine Strenge bekannte Erziehungssystem Spartas bezeichnet, das ein wichtiger Bestandteil des spartanischen Staates war. Jeder m&#228;nnliche spartanische Staatsb&#252;rger, mit Ausnahme der vom K&#246;nig abstammenden, musste sie in k&#246;rperlich anspruchsvollem Training absolvieren. Antike Autoren wie Platon, Xenophon oder Isokrates sahen in dieser Erziehung den Grund f&#252;r Spartas milit&#228;rischen Erfolg.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Diese Erziehung umfasste haupts&#228;chlich das milit&#228;risch strukturierte Training im Jagen, Tanzen und der sozialen Umgangsweise, aber auch die Trennung der Familien und die Pflege und Kultivierung der Treue innerhalb einer Gruppe. Sie wurde angeblich vom halb-mythologischen spartanischen Gesetzgeber Lykurgos eingef&#252;hrt, doch wurde sie erst sp&#228;ter, zwischen dem 6. und 7. Jahrhundert v. Chr., zum Trainieren von Jungen im Alter von sieben bis zwanzig Jahren angewandt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Das Ziel dieses Erziehungssystems war es, der spartanischen Armee k&#246;rperlich und moralisch gefestigte M&#228;nner zur Verf&#252;gung zu stellen. Jeder junge Mann in Sparta, der einzigen Stadt ohne Verteidigungsmauern, der zur Mauer Spartas geh&#246;ren wollte, musste sich an die harten Regeln des Lykurgos halten. Die jungen M&#228;nner f&#246;rderten sich ebenfalls, indem sie sich gegenseitig ermutigten und auch gegeneinander k&#228;mpften, um bestimmen zu k&#246;nnen, wer der St&#228;rkste in der Gruppe sei.</German>

		<Spanish>La agog&#233; o educaci&#243;n espartana (gr. 'conducta, movimiento') fue junto al radical rechazo del individualismo y la militarizaci&#243;n de toda la vida privada y colectiva, el rasgo m&#225;s caracter&#237;stico y definitorio de la sociedad lacedemonia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Desde los siglos VIII al VII a. C., la educaci&#243;n espartana se consagra al dominio de las armas. Los j&#243;venes espartanos no deb&#237;an buscar ya, como en los siglos anteriores, su gloria personal (ideal hom&#233;rico), sino la colectiva, la victoria de la ciudad. El poeta Tirteo plasma bien esta novedad &#233;tica: "es bello morir, en primera l&#237;nea, como valiente que lucha por su patria".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La educaci&#243;n arcaica conserva, no obstante, rasgos de la educaci&#243;n hom&#233;rica: la lucha, el atletismo y los deportes h&#237;picos mantienen una gran importancia. En los Juegos Ol&#237;mpicos, desde el 720 al 576 a. C., de 81 ganadores conocidos, 46 son espartanos; en cuanto a la carrera a pie, conocemos 36 ganadores, de los cuales 21 son espartanos. Inmediatamente a continuaci&#243;n en importancia viene la m&#250;sica (en esta &#233;poca Esparta es la capital musical de Grecia). Las diversas fiestas (Jacintias, Carneas o incluso las Gimnopedias) son apenas un pretexto para los concursos de danza de un alto nivel de refinamiento, que precisan de entrenamiento especializado.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A partir del siglo VI (hacia el 550 a. C.), la educaci&#243;n cambia de naturaleza. Se convertir&#225; en la agog&#233; (aunque este nombre es en realidad de &#233;poca helen&#237;stica): un sistema educativo profundamente original en su &#233;poca por sus caracter&#237;sticas, ya que es:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  Obligatorio: constituye un requisito indispensable para la plena ciudadan&#237;a. Para Jenofonte, aquellos que no han pasado por la agog&#233; son ciudadanos de categor&#237;a inferior que no pueden acceder a las magistraturas ni a los cuerpos de &#233;lite o, seg&#250;n Plutarco, son directamente privados de sus derechos ciudadanos. Por el contrario, se puede dar el caso de no ciudadanos (presumiblemente ilotas) que, aceptados en el sistema educativo de la agog&#233;, llegan a ser hombres libres: son los llamados mothak&#233;s (ver Ilota).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  Colectivo: frente a la educaci&#243;n personalizada con un preceptor esclavo, al estilo de otras ciudades griegas, la agog&#233; se estructura en etapas para grupos de ni&#241;os de edad similar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  Organizado por el Estado: es el propio gobierno de la ciudad el que gestiona la educaci&#243;n p&#250;blica como una de sus principales misiones, lo que merecer&#225; la alabanza de Plat&#243;n y Arist&#243;teles. Adem&#225;s de contar con magistrados especializados, los &#233;foros llevan a cabo personalmente una supervisi&#243;n diaria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A partir de este momento los ciudadanos se preparan para la vida militar ya desde la misma infancia. A los siete a&#241;os se les aparta de sus familias y comienzan a vivir en barracones de estilo militar con los compa&#241;eros de su misma edad, sometidos a un entrenamiento que busca convertirlos en guerreros perfectos, preocupados s&#243;lo por el bien del Estado.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aunque la agog&#233; se atribuye a Licurgo, no se encuentra referencia hist&#243;rica alguna a ella hasta el siglo IV a. C., en concreto en Jenofonte (Rep&#250;blica de los Lacedemonios ).</Spanish>

Se encontraban en un cementerio mayor, destinado a todo tipo de personas y que conten&#237;a m&#225;s de 2.500 tumbas. Cada una de las tumbas reales conten&#237;a un cuerpo principal y un cierto n&#250;mero de acompa&#241;antes, as&#237; como numerosas riquezas.[NEWLINE]De todas las sepulturas, destacaba la de una reina identificada gracias a su sello cil&#237;ndrico como Puabi. En su interior, adem&#225;s de la reina, se encontraban los cuerpos de cinco hombres armados y diez mujeres acompa&#241;adas por la magn&#237;fica Arpa de Ur rematada por la cabeza de un toro en oro. La c&#225;mara conten&#237;a incluso un carro y los esqueletos de dos bueyes. El cuerpo de la reina estaba envuelto en joyas y mantos con incrustaciones. Sobre la cabeza llevaba un tocado a base de hojas y una peineta rematada por estrellas de cinco puntas. Cerca de su mano ten&#237;a una copa de oro. Debajo de un ba&#250;l hab&#237;a un pasadizo que comunicaba con otra c&#225;mara funeraria; en ella se encontraba el rey A-kalam-dug de Ur, cuya tumba hab&#237;a sido parcialmente saqueada.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Otra de las tumbas reales pertenec&#237;a al lugal Meskalamdug.

Es en esta &#250;ltima tumba donde se encontr&#243; el Estandarte de Ur, una de las piezas m&#225;s c&#233;lebres de las halladas en Ur. El estandarte, est&#225; dividido en distintas franjas que contienen escenas cotidianas y de guerra, en la que destaca la representaci&#243;n de carros de guerra.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se ha interpretado de diferentes formas el hecho de que las tumbas reales contuviesen cuerpos de sus sirvientes; para algunos autores, se trataba de enterramientos rituales, en los que el monarca era acompa&#241;ado por &#233;stos hacia el m&#225;s all&#225;.

		<English>Enlil was the name of a chief deity listed and written about in ancient Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Canaanite and other Mesopotamian clay and stone tablets.[NEWLINE]According to the Tummal Chronicle, Enmebaragesi, an early ruler of Kish, was the first to build up this temple in Nippur. Nippur never enjoyed political hegemony in its own right, but its control was crucial, as it was considered capable of conferring the overall "kingship" on monarchs from other city-states. It was distinctively a sacred city, important from the possession of the famous shrine of Enlil. His influence over Nippur has also been detected archaeologically. The Chronicle lists successive early Sumerian rulers who kept up intermittent ceremonies at the temple. It also indicates that the practice was revived in Neo-Sumerian times. Inscriptions of kings of Uruk and Ur respectively, and of other early pre-Semitic rulers, on door-sockets and stone vases, show the veneration in which the ancient shrine was then held, and the importance attached to its possession, as giving a certain stamp of legitimacy. On their votive offerings, some of these rulers designate themselves as ensis, or governors.</English>

		<Spanish>Enlil en la mitolog&#237;a sumeria (tambi&#233;n, a veces, Ellil en textos posteriores acadios, hititas o caananitas), era el dios del cielo, del viento, las tempestades y la respiraci&#243;n.

Seg&#250;n el primero vendr&#237;a del sumerio (nlin, EN.L&#205;L, de EN = "Se&#241;or + L&#205;L = "Tormenta" o "Viento" ), por lo que su nombre significar&#237;a literalmente, "Se&#241;or de la tormenta" o "Se&#241;or del viento" o "dios del viento".

		<English>The Olympiad was one of the ways the Greeks measured time. The Olympic Games were used as a starting point, year one of the cycle; the Nemean and Isthmian Games were both held (in different months) in year two, followed by the Pythian Games in year three, and then the Nemean and Isthmian Games again in year four. The cycle then repeated itself with the Olympic Games. They were structured this way so that individual athletes could participate in all of the games.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honoring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his temple at Olympia) and Pelops, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. The Olympic Games reached their zenith in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece. There is no consensus on when the Games officially ended, the most common-held date is 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I declared that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated. Another date cited is 426 AD, when his successor Theodosius II ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.</English>

		<English>The Kepos, Greek for garden, was a certain place in Athens, at which one of the four large philosophical schools of ancient time was founded by the Greek philosopher Epicurus (approx. 341-270 BC). This school was the centre of the philosophy Epicureanism, named after his founder, which postulated a rational controlled life of pleasure to reach the individual salvation and happiness. Later the doctrine of Epicurus was introduced in Rome by Lucretius (99-56 BC) and became an important direction of thought beside the Stoicism.

		<English>Isis or in original more likely Aset was a goddess in Ancient Egyptian religious beliefs, whose worship spread throughout the Greco-Roman world. She was worshiped as the ideal mother and wife as well as the matron of nature and magic. She was the friend of slaves, sinners, artisans, the downtrodden, as well as listening to the prayers of the wealthy, maidens, aristocrats and rulers.

		<German>Den &#196;gyptern galt sie als G&#246;ttin der Liebe, als Meerg&#246;ttin, Gottesmutter, Sonnenmutter, K&#246;nigin des westlichen Himmels, als Zauberin, da sie sich in ihrer Beziehung zu Horus und Osiris der Zauberei bediente, und sp&#228;ter Mondg&#246;ttin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Die &#228;gyptischen Pharaonen beriefen sich darauf, S&#246;hne der Isis zu sein und ihr Scho&#223; wurde als k&#246;niglicher Thron angesehen.

Sp&#228;ter wurde ihre Gestalt in &#196;gypten mit anderen &#228;gyptischen Gottheiten (besonders Hathor) vermischt. Und durch die Missionierungsarbeit der &#228;gyptischen Isis-Priester wurde ihr Kult unter den Ptolem&#228;ern im ganzen R&#246;mischen Reich popul&#228;r. Isis wurde bis ins 5. oder 6. Jahrhundert in &#196;gypten verehrt und ihr dienten nur Priesterinnen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Durch die sp&#228;tere Vermischung mit der Hathor erhielt sie au&#223;erdem als Kopfzierde Kuhh&#246;rner mit einer Sonnenscheibe. Oft wurde sie auf Gruft- und Sarkophagw&#228;nden mit ausgebreiteten Fl&#252;geln dargestellt, mit denen sie die Toten besch&#252;tzte und Luft zuwedelte. Die Kuhh&#246;rner bedeuten zugleich die Mondsichel. Als G&#246;ttin der Magie und der Toten wurde Isis, v.a. in sp&#228;terer Zeit, auch als Mondg&#246;ttin gedeutet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Im Hellenismus setzte man den lebenden K&#246;nig, den man mit Horus gleichsetzte, mit dem Osiris als dem verstorbenen K&#246;nig in Verbindung, so wurde Isis auch mit dem Osirismythos in Beziehung gebracht, und dadurch Teil des so genannten Isis- und Osiriskultes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]&#220;ber die Ptolem&#228;er und den hellenistischen Kulturkreis kam dann auch der r&#246;mische Kulturkreis in Kontakt mit dem Isis-Kult. In der r&#246;mischen Republik und zu Anfang des Kaiserreiches, zuletzt unter Tiberius, teilweise verboten, etablierte sich der Isis-Kult endg&#252;ltig unter Kaiser Caligula im r&#246;mischen Imperium.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Der einzige vollst&#228;ndig erhaltene lateinische Roman der Antike, der Goldene Esel des Apuleius, handelt von den Isis-Mysterien.

		<English>A Serapion (lat. serapeum) is a temple or other religious institution dedicated to the syncretic Hellenistic-Egyptian god Serapis, who combined aspects of Osiris and Apis in a humanized form that was accepted by the Ptolemaic Greeks of Alexandria. There were several such religious centers, each of which was a serapeion or, in its Latinized form, a serapeum. The Serapeum of Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt was a temple built by Ptolemy III (reigned 246-222 BCE) and dedicated to Serapis, the syncretic Hellenistic-Egyptian god who was made the protector of Alexandria. By all detailed accounts, the Serapeum was the largest and most magnificent of all temples in the Greek quarter of Alexandria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Serapeum was the last stronghold of the pagans who fortified themselves in the temple and its enclosure 394. The sanctuary was stormed by the Christians. The pagans were driven out, the temple was sacked, and its contents were destroyed. In this struggle the Library presumably perished also.</English>

		<Italian>Shulgi, the successor of Ur-Namma, can be considered the most learned ruler in Mesopotamian history alongside the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. He boasted that he had mastered numerous foreign languages, including Amurrian, Elamite and even the language of the Indus civilization called Melucha, and that he was a gifted mathematician, interpreter of omens and musician. A number of literary academies called &#233;-dub-ba-a (literally: house in which clay tablets are distributed) were founded in Shulgi's time. Among the consistently Sumerian texts studied by student scribes and scholars in these academies were royal hymns, myths, and epics, first written down or edited into new versions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In ancient Greek and Roman it was usual, that children had to visit the school. A basic education was passed in a kind of primary school, called "ludus litterarius" by the Romans, in which mostly slaves taught the subjects reading, writing and calculation. In Roman time children of the upper class then visited the secondary grammar and rhetoric schools, in which they were prepared in the subjects grammar, rhetoric, philosophy and law for the later civil service.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Shulgi, el sucesor de Ur-Namma, puede considerarse el gobernante m&#225;s erudito de la historia de Mesopotamia junto con el rey asirio Ashurbanipal. Se jact&#243; de haber dominado numerosos idiomas extranjeros, incluidos el amurrio, elamita e incluso el idioma de la civilizaci&#243;n del Indo llamado melucha, y que era un matem&#225;tico talentoso, int&#233;rprete de presagios y m&#250;sico. En la &#233;poca de Shulgi se fundaron varias academias literarias llamadas &#233;-dub-ba-a (literalmente: casa en la que se distribuyen las tablillas de arcilla). Entre los textos consistentemente sumerios estudiados por estudiantes escribas y eruditos en estas academias se encontraban himnos reales, mitos y epopeyas, primero escritos o editados en nuevas versiones.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Con la expansi&#243;n de Roma, sobre todo al conquistar Grecia, se hizo necesario abrir nuevos caminos en el mundo de la educaci&#243;n. As&#237;, las familias que ten&#237;an medios pudieron disponer del siguiente plan de estudios para sus hijos:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]De peque&#241;os pod&#237;an tener un maestro en casa (magister), que generalmente era un esclavo o liberto griego o bien ir a una escuela llevados por un esclavo (p&#230;dagogus) que despu&#233;s tambi&#233;n les repasaba las lecciones en casa. En la primera etapa educativa, el ni&#241;o aprend&#237;a con un maestro (magister ludi, litterator y calculator) a leer, escribir y hacer cuentas. La disciplina era severa, pero los ni&#241;os jugaban con letras de madera o marfil y con ellas aprend&#237;an a leer y a escribir. Por eso a esta escuela le llaman juego (ludus) y el maestro era magister ludi. La escuela se situaba en un peque&#241;o cuarto (taberna, pergula), en una caba&#241;a o en el jard&#237;n (seg&#250;n el tiempo y las posibilidades). El maestro ten&#237;a una silla (cathedra) o un taburete (sella). Los ni&#241;os se sentaban en esca&#241;os (subsellia). Los instrumentos de trabajo eran unas tablas enceradas (tabul&#230;, cer&#230;) en las que rascaban con punzones (stilus) que por un lado eran puntiagudos y por otro acababan en una esp&#225;tula con la que se alisaba la cera y as&#237; quedaba lista para volver a escribir en ella (stilum vertere).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La segunda etapa pod&#237;a ser privada o p&#250;blica. El profesor era el grammaticus que ense&#241;aba a entender y comentar los textos literarios. Comentando los textos cl&#225;sicos, los ni&#241;os aprend&#237;an de todo: geograf&#237;a, historia, f&#237;sica, religi&#243;n, etc. Con el tiempo, la grammatica empezar&#237;a a ser tambi&#233;n estudio sobre la lengua que hablaban y esta innovaci&#243;n acabar&#237;a eliminando el primitivo concepto de grammatica. La tercer etapa preparaba en la elocuencia al futuro pol&#237;tico romano. El profesor era el rhetor (maestro de oratoria). Quintiliano, por ejemplo, escribi&#243; muchas notas pedag&#243;gicas de c&#243;mo formar al orador. Entre los ejercicios frecuentes estaba la realizaci&#243;n de juicios ficticios en los que unos alumnos acusaban y otros defend&#237;an.</Spanish>

		<English>The gymnasion in ancient Greece functioned as a training facility for competitors in public games. It was also a place for socializing and engaging in intellectual pursuits.

The Greek gymnasions also held lectures and discussions on philosophy, literature, and music, and public libraries were nearby.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rome as a republic or an empire never formally instituted a state-sponsored form of elementary education. It was typical for Roman children of wealthy families to receive their early education from private tutors. However, it was common for children of more humble means to be instructed in a primary school, traditionally known as a ludus litterarius. An instructor in such a school was often known as a litterator or litteratus, which was seen as a more respectable title. There was nothing stopping a litterator from setting up his own school, aside from his meager wages. There were never any established locations for a ludus litterarius. They could be found in a variety of places, anywhere from a private residence to a gymnasium, or even in the street.</English>

Gymnasia, deutsch oft Gymnasien, kommt daher, dass die Athleten sich vorher in Umkleider&#228;umen ganz auszogen und so nackt trainierten. Au&#223;erdem rieben sie ihren K&#246;rper mit &#214;l ein. Anschlie&#223;end lie&#223;en sie Staub und Sand &#252;ber ihren nackten K&#246;rper rieseln.

		<English>A Brothel is an establishment specifically dedicated to prostitution, providing the prostitutes a place to meet and to have sexual intercourse with clients. In the Ancient Near East along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers there were many shrines and temples or "houses of heaven" dedicated to various deities. As early as the 18th century B.C., the ancient society of Mesopotamia recognized the need to protect women's property rights. In the Code of Hammurabi, provisions were found that addressed inheritance rights of women, including female prostitutes In ancient Greek society, prostitution was engaged in by both women and boys. In ancient Rome, a registered prostitute was called a meretrix while the unregistered one fell under the broad category prostibulae. There were some commonalities with the Greek system; but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign slaves, captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose, sometimes by large-scale "prostitute farmers" who took abandoned children. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes.</English>

Dans l'ancien Proche-Orient, le long des fleuves Tigre et Euphrate, il y avait de nombreux sanctuaires et temples ou &#171; maisons du ciel &#187; d&#233;di&#233;s &#224; diverses divinit&#233;s.

		<Italian>A taberna (plural tabernae) was a single room shop covered by a barrel vault within great indoor markets of ancient Rome. Each taberna had a window above it to let light into a wooden attic for storage and had a wide doorway. A taberna was a "retail unit" within the Roman empire and furthermore was where many economic activities and many service industries were provided, including the sale of cooked food, wine and bread. Tabernae probably first appeared in Greece in locations that were important for economic activities around the end of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C..</Italian>
		<Spanish>En la Antigua Roma, una taberna (del lat&#237;n taberna, plural tabernae) ten&#237;a varias acepciones.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Originalmente, designaba una choza o caba&#241;a que posteriormente se dedicar&#237;a a dep&#243;sito y que pasar&#237;an a ser gen&#233;ricamente tiendas. Estas tabernae se situaban generalmente en los bajos de las insulae, abiertas a las v&#237;as principales de las ciudades. Los locales, individuales, con gran portada, sol&#237;an estar cubiertos con b&#243;veda de ca&#241;&#243;n y dispon&#237;an una ventana encima de ella para que entrara la luz a una buhardilla de madera que serv&#237;a de almacenamiento. Se puede apreciar este modelo en los grandes mercados romanos, como en el famoso de Trajano en Roma, construido entre los a&#241;os 107 y 110 por Apolodoro de Damasco. En este mercado, las 150 tiendas o tabernae estaban distribuidas entre sus cinco pisos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]De acuerdo con la Cambridge Ancient History, una taberna era una "unidad minorista", en el Imperio romano donde ten&#237;an lugar muchas actividades econ&#243;micas y de servicios incluyendo el comercio y venta de fruta, pan, vino, aceite, pescado, carne, especias (pipera), etc. o talleres de artesanos. Se habla de tabernae vinariae a los establecimientos especializados en el consumo de vino y comida y de taberna argentaria al establecimiento dedicado a la banca.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Este tipo de comercio, probablemente apareci&#243; por primera vez en la Antigua Grecia en los lugares que fueron importantes para las actividades econ&#243;micas en torno a finales de los siglos V y IV a. C. Con la expansi&#243;n del Imperio Romano en el Mediterr&#225;neo, se increment&#243; el n&#250;mero de tabernae, haci&#233;ndolas importantes en la econom&#237;a urbana de las ciudades o colonias romanas como en Pompeya, Ostia, Corinto, Delos, Cartagena o Narbona. Muchas de estas ciudades fueron importantes puertos desde donde se importaban tambi&#233;n, bienes ex&#243;ticos y de lujo.</Spanish>

		<English>The nuraghe (plural Italian nuraghi, Sardinian nuraghes) is the main type of ancient megalithic edifice found in Sardinia, Italy. Today it has come to be the symbol of Sardinia and its distinctive culture, the Nuragic civilization. The typical nuraghe is situated in a panoramic spot and has the shape of a truncated conical tower resembling a beehive. The structure has no foundations and stands only by virtue of the weight of its stones, which may weigh as much as several tons. Some nuraghes are more than 20 metres in height.</English>

		<Spanish>Un nuraga (plural en italiano, nuraghi; en sardo nuraghe; en espa&#241;ol nuragas) es el principal tipo de edificio megal&#237;tico que se puede encontrar en Cerde&#241;a, remont&#225;ndose a a&#241;os anteriores al 1000 a. C. Actualmente se ha convertido en el s&#237;mbolo de Cerde&#241;a y su cultura distintiva.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El t&#237;pico nuraga est&#225; situado en un lugar panor&#225;mico y tiene la forma de una torre con forma geom&#233;trica de cono truncado o divido por la mitad, algunos mas altos otros muy bajos, recordando a un tholos. La estructura no tiene cimientos y se sostiene s&#243;lo por el peso de las piedras que la forman, que pueden alcanzar varias toneladas. Algunos nuragas miden m&#225;s de 20 metros de alto. Actualmente, hay m&#225;s de 8000 nuragas a&#250;n existentes en Cerde&#241;a, aunque se ha estimado que en el pasado pudieron existir m&#225;s de 30.000. Los nuragas prevalecen sobre todo en el noroeste y el centro de la parte meridional de la isla.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hay un tipo similar de estructura que tiene un corredor o un conjunto de corredores. Algunos autores consideran inadecuado incluir este tipo de estructura dentro de los nuragas y prefieren el t&#233;rmino pueblo nur&#225;gico.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los nuragas se construyeron en &#233;poca indeterminada (no antes del VI milenio a. C.). Aunque algunos de ellos se han datado del 3500 a. C., la mayor parte de ellos se cree que se construyeron entre mediados de la Edad de Bronce (siglo XVIII-siglo XV a. C.) y la Edad de Bronce tard&#237;a. Muchos estaban en uso continuado desde su erecci&#243;n hasta que Roma entr&#243; en Cerde&#241;a en el siglo II a. C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seg&#250;n Massimo Pallottino, un estudioso de la prehistoria sarda y etrusc&#243;logo, la arquitectura producida por la civilizaci&#243;n nur&#225;gica fue la m&#225;s avanzada de cualquier civilizaci&#243;n del Mediterr&#225;neo occidental durante esta &#233;poca, incluyendo las de las regiones de la Magna Grecia. De los 8.000 nuragas existentes, s&#243;lo unos pocos se han excavado cient&#237;ficamente. Algunos sostienen que edificios redondos o de planta circular, son t&#237;picos de pueblos n&#243;madas. De ello deducen algunos que los antiguos sardos estaban continuamente cambiando de poblaci&#243;n.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El uso de los nuragas no se ha determinado con claridad, se&#241;al&#225;ndose que pudieron ser templos religiosos, alojamientos cotidianos, la residencia de los jefes del pueblo, fortalezas militares, salas de reuni&#243;n de l&#237;deres, o una combinaci&#243;n de algunas de estas finalidades. Algunos de los nuragas est&#225;n, sin embargo, en ubicaciones estrat&#233;gicas respecto a importantes pasos que podr&#237;an ser controlados f&#225;cilmente.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sin duda, los nuragas ten&#237;an un contenido simb&#243;lico significativo. Pod&#237;an transmitir riqueza o poder, o ser un indicativo de que el lugar era un pueblo. Teor&#237;as recientes tienden a creer que las villas sardas eran ciudades-estado independientes, aunque no fueran ciudades en sentido estricto, que formaban federaciones y que la construcci&#243;n de estos monumentos pod&#237;an haber dependido de una distribuci&#243;n previamente acordada del territorio entre las villas federadas.</Spanish>

		<Spanish>Un dolmen, que en bret&#243;n quiere decir mesa grande de piedra, es una construcci&#243;n megal&#237;tica consistente por lo general en varias losas (ortostatos) hincadas en la tierra en posici&#243;n vertical y una losa de cubierta apoyada sobre ellas en posici&#243;n horizontal.

Se distinguen dos tipos de salinas, las costeras, situadas en la costa para utilizar el agua de mar, y las de interior, en las que se utilizan manantiales de agua salada debidos a que el agua atraviesa dep&#243;sitos de sal subterr&#225;neos.

		<English>The earliest named gladiator school (ludus) is that of Aurelius Scaurus at Capua he was lanista of the gladiators employed by the state ca 105 BC to instruct the legions and simultaneously entertain the public. Few other lanistae are known by name: they were head of their familia gladiatoria, with legal power over life and death of every family member, including servi poenae, auctorati and ancillaries but socially they were infames, on a footing with pimps and butchers and despised as price gougers. No such stigma attached to a gladiator owner (munerarius or editor) of good family, high status and independent means; Cicero congratulated his friend Atticus on buying a splendid troop if he rented them out, he might recover their entire cost after two performances.</English>

		<German>Gladiatoren wurden in besonderen Schulen (ludi) ausgebildet. Ber&#252;hmte Gladiatorenschulen befanden sich in Capua und in dem 79 n. Chr. durch einen Vulkanausbruch versch&#252;tteten Pompeji. Eine der gr&#246;&#223;ten Gladiatorenschulen war in Ravenna beheimatet. Nach Sch&#228;tzungen gab es insgesamt etwas mehr als 100 Gladiatorenschulen, die normalerweise unter Leitung eines Gladiatorenmeisters standen, der auch der Besitzer der Gladiatorenschule war. H&#228;ufig reisten Gladiatoren in einer Truppe (familia) von Stadt zu Stadt. Der Besitzer der Truppe vermietete seine Gladiatoren an denjenigen, der einen Gladiatorenkampf veranstalten wollte.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Rom gab es vier Gladiatorenschulen, die gr&#246;&#223;te nannte sich Ludus Magnus und war mit dem sp&#228;ter Kolosseum genannten Flavischen Amphitheater durch einen Tunnel verbunden.

		<Spanish>Como eran muchos los sistemas pensados para combatir y variados los lances y suertes de cada combate, se fijaron reglas al arte del gladiador, cuya ense&#241;anza estaba encomendada a los lanistas o gladiadores viejos.

Otros lanistas reclutaban y manten&#237;an muchachos para combatir en la arena, que luego alquilaban para funerales, comidas y otras solemnidades.

Verwaltet wurde eine Provinz von einem Pr&#228;fekt (lateinisch praefectus, von praeficere = vorsetzen), welcher von einem Magistrat oder dem Kaiser mit der Wahrnehmung einer bestimmten Aufgabe in Verwaltung oder Milit&#228;r betraut wurde.

Sin embargo, debido a los materiales utilizados, corr&#237;an el riesgo del fuego y de las armas de sitio. Por este motivo (si hab&#237;a tiempo y medios), las paredes de piedra (por ejemplo), se prefer&#237;an a las empalizadas de madera.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A menudo las empalizadas se constru&#237;an alrededor de un castillo, como un muro temporal para construir el de piedra permanente.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las empalizadas tambi&#233;n se utilizaban como protecci&#243;n en las justas medievales.</Spanish>

La Biblia, o al menos parte de ella, se encuentra traducida a 2 303 idiomas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La Biblia es una compilaci&#243;n de textos que en un principio eran documentos separados (llamados libros), escritos primero en hebreo, arameo y griego durante un periodo muy dilatado y despu&#233;s reunidos para formar el Tanaj (Antiguo Testamento para los cristianos) y luego el Nuevo Testamento. Ambos testamentos forman la Biblia cristiana. En s&#237; la Biblia fue escrita a lo largo de aproximadamente 1 000 a&#241;os (entre el 900 a. C. y el 100 d. C.).

		<Spanish>Algunas de las primeras traducciones del Torah jud&#237;o se realizaron durante el primer exilio en Babilonia, cuando el arameo se convirti&#243; en la lingua franca de los jud&#237;os. Dado que muchas personas hablaban solo en arameo y no entend&#237;an hebreo, se crearon los Targums para permitir que las personas comunes pudieran entender la Torah cuando era leida en las sinagogas antiguas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La Tanakh estaba escrita en su mayor parte en hebreo b&#237;blico, con algunos trozos (especialmente en el Libro de Daniel y el Libro de Esdras) en arameo b&#237;blico.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Otras antiguas traducciones jud&#237;as, tales como los Targums en arameo, siguen de cerca el texto masor&#233;tico de la Biblia hebrea, y todas las traducciones jud&#237;as medievales y modernas se basan en la misma fuente.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El movimiento m&#225;s difundido para traducir libros de la Biblia hizo su aparici&#243;n en el siglo tercero para traducir libros de la Biblia que se remontaban al siglo III AdC. La mayor&#237;a del Tanakh exist&#237;a en hebreo, pero muchos jud&#237;os viv&#237;an en Egipto, en donde Alejandro Magno hab&#237;a fundado Alejandria. En cierta &#233;poca un tercio de la poblaci&#243;n de esta ciudad eran jud&#237;os helenos. Sin embargo, no se intent&#243; realizar ninguna traducci&#243;n de relevancia (ya que la mayor&#237;a de los jud&#237;os continuaban hablando en arameo entre ellos) hasta que Ptolomeo II Filadelfo contrat&#243; a un gran grupo de jud&#237;os (entre 15 y 72 seg&#250;n distintas fuentes) que pose&#237;an un flu&#237;do dominio del griego koin&#233; y hebreo. Estas personas realizaron la traducci&#243;n actualmente denominada la Septuaginta.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Desde el 800 hasta el 1400, estudiosos jud&#237;os actualmente denominados Masoretas compararon los textos de todos los manuscritos b&#237;blicos conocidos en un esfuerzo por crear un texto &#250;nico estandarizado. Como resultado de este esfuerzo aparecieron una serie de textos sumamente similares, todos los cuales son denominados Textos Masor&#233;ticos (MT). Los Masoretes tambi&#233;n agregaron puntos vocales al texto (llamados niqud), ya que el texto original solo conten&#237;a consonantes. Este proceso a veces requer&#237;a la elecci&#243;n de una denominada interpretaci&#243;n, dado que algunas palabras solo se diferenciaban por sus vocales &#8211; su significado dependiendo de cuales vocales se utilicen. En la antig&#252;edad, exist&#237;an varias lecturas o interpretaciones en hebreo, algunas de las cuales han sobrevivido en el Pentateuco Samaritano, los pergaminos del Mar Muerto, y otros fragmentos antiguos, adem&#225;s de existir referencias a ellas en versiones antiguas en otros idiomas.[NEWLINE]Los jud&#237;os tambi&#233;n escribieron traducciones noliterales o parafrases denominadas targums, especialmente en arameo. A menudo expand&#237;an y elaboraban el texto con detalles adicionales tomados de la tradici&#243;n oral rab&#237;nica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la obra Hexapla de Or&#237;genes de Alejandria se presentan en forma comparativa seis versiones del Viejo Testamento, incluida la traducci&#243;n griega del siglo II de Aquila de Sinope y Simaco el Ebionita. Esta elaboraci&#243;n ecl&#233;ctica de la Septuaginta tuvo una influencia significativa en el texto del Viejo Testamento en varios manuscritos importantes. La Biblia Cristiana can&#243;nica fue establecida formalmente por el Obispo Cirilo de Jerusalen en el 350 (aunque de hecho ya hab&#237;a sido aceptada por la iglesia), siendo confirmada por el Concilio de Laodicea en el 363 (ambas no incluian el Libro de las Revelaciones), y posteriormente promulgada por Atanasio de Alejandr&#237;a en el 367 (con el agregado del Libro de las Revelaciones), y la traducci&#243;n al lat&#237;n denominada Vulgata de Jer&#243;nimo de Estrid&#243;n se remontan al 382 a.C. y 420. Las traducciones al latin anteriores a Jer&#243;nimo son denominadas en forma gen&#233;rica como textos Vetus Latina.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La primera de todas las traducciones de la Biblia hebrea al griego fue la denominada Septuaginta (LXX), que luego se convierte en el texto aceptado del Viejo Testamento en la iglesia y la base de sus canones. La denominada Vulgata en latin realizada por Jer&#243;nimo estaba basada en la versi&#243;n en hebreo de aquellos libros de la Biblia que se hab&#237;an conservado en el canon judio (tal como se presentaban en el texto masor&#233;tico), y del texto griego de los libros deuterocanonicos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las traducciones cristianas tambi&#233;n tend&#237;an a basarse en la versi&#243;n en hebreo, aunque algunas prefieren la Septuaginta (o pueden presentar citas alternativas de ambas). Las traducciones de la Biblia que incorporan cr&#237;ticas textuales modernas por lo general comienzan con el texto masor&#233;tico, pero tambi&#233;n tienen en cuenta posibles variantes de todas las versiones antiguas disponibles. El Textus Receptus del Nuevo Testamento cristiano se encuentra en griego koin&#233;, y casi todas las traducciones est&#225;n basadas en un texto griego.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Durante el siglo II o III a.C, la Torah fue traducida al griego koin&#233;, y durante el siguiente siglo, otros libros fueron tambi&#233;n traducidos. Esta traducci&#243;n se denomin&#243; la Septuaginta. "Sin embargo, no fue hasta la &#233;poca de Agust&#237;n de Hipona (354-430 CE) que la traducci&#243;n griega de las escrituras jud&#237;as pas&#243; a ser conocida por el t&#233;rmino en lat&#237;n septuaginta."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jer&#243;nimo comenz&#243; revisando las primeras traducciones latinas, pero termin&#243; retrotay&#233;ndose al original griego, salt&#225;ndose todas las traducciones, y retornando al hebreo original cada vez que pudo en vez de utilizar la Septuaginta. En el siglo IV Ulfilas tradujo el Nuevo Testamento al g&#243;tico. En el siglo V, San Mesrob tradujo la Biblia al armenio. De la misma &#233;poca son las traducciones sir&#237;aca, copta, et&#237;ope y georgiana.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el 331, el emperador Constantino le encarg&#243; a Eusebio que produjera cincuenta Biblias para la Iglesia de Constantinopla. Atanasio (Apol. Const. 4) escribi&#243; que unos 340 escribas alejandrinos prepararon Biblias para el emperador Constante. Poco m&#225;s se sabe, aunque abundan las especulaciones. Por ejemplo, se especula que esto puede haber servido de motivaci&#243;n para las listas de c&#225;nones, y el Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209, el Codex Sinaiticus y el Codex Alexandrinus son ejemplo de estas Biblias.

		<English>An acropolis (means upper city) was in ancient Greece a settlement, especially a citadel, built upon an area of elevated ground; frequently a hill with precipitous sides, chosen for purposes of defense. Acropolis also had a function of a religious sanctuary with sacred springs highlighting its religious significance. Acropolis became the centre of large cities of classical antiquity, such as Athens, Argos, Thebes, Corinth. The most famous Acropolis is that of Athens, which in ancient times was named Kekropia in honor of Kekrops, the first king of Athens.</English>
		<French>Une acropole (signifie ville haute) &#233;tait dans la Gr&#232;ce antique une colonie, en particulier une citadelle, construite sur une zone de terrain &#233;lev&#233;; souvent une colline aux flancs escarp&#233;s, choisie &#224; des fins de d&#233;fense. L'Acropole avait &#233;galement une fonction de sanctuaire religieux avec des sources sacr&#233;es soulignant sa signification religieuse. L'Acropole est devenue le centre des grandes villes de l'antiquit&#233; classique, telles qu'Ath&#232;nes, Argos, Th&#232;bes, Corinthe. L'Acropole la plus c&#233;l&#232;bre est celle d'Ath&#232;nes, qui dans l'Antiquit&#233; s'appelait Kekropia en l'honneur de Kekrops, le premier roi d'Ath&#232;nes.</French>
		<German>Der Begriff Akropolis (w&#246;rtlich &#252;bersetzt: Obere/Oberste Stadt) bezeichnet den zu einer antiken griechischen Stadt geh&#246;renden Burgberg beziehungsweise die Wehranlage, die zumeist auf der h&#246;chsten Erhebung nahe der Stadt erbaut wurde. Die Akropolis entsprach somit einer Zitadelle (Begriff f&#252;r mittelalterliche und fr&#252;hneuzeitliche Anlagen), jedoch entwickelte sie sich im Laufe der Zeit von einer Wehranlage auf dem Burgberg auch zum Kultplatz mit den wichtigsten Heiligt&#252;mern. Der Begriff Akropolis war fr&#252;her ausschlie&#223;lich auf den antiken griechischen Kulturkreis beschr&#228;nkt und kann aber heute f&#252;r viele derartige Befestigungen, wie beispielsweise das Kapitol in Rom, verwendet werden. Die bekannteste Akropolis ist die von Athen die in der Antike zu Ehren von Kekrops, dem ersten K&#246;nig Athens, Kekropia genannt wurde.</German>

		<English>[TAB]The Ishtar Gate was the eighth gate to the inner city of Babylon. It was constructed in about 575 BC by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II on the north side of the city. Dedicated to the Assyrian goddess Ishtar, the Gate was constructed of blue glazed tiles with alternating rows of bas-relief sirrush (dragons) and aurochs. The roof and doors of the gate were of cedar, according to the dedication plaque. Through the gate ran the Processional Way which was lined with walls covered in lions on glazed bricks (about 120 of them). Statues of the gods were paraded through the gate and down the Processional Way each year during the New Year's celebration. It was originally considered one of the Seven Wonders of the world until, in the 6th century AD, it was replaced with the Lighthouse of Alexandria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate and Processional Way was built at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin out of material excavated by Robert Koldewey and finished in the 1930s. It includes the inscription plaque. It stands 47 feet high and 100 feet wide (14 meters by 30 meters). The excavation ran from 1902-1914 and during that time 45 ft of the foundation of the gate was uncovered. Parts of the gate and lions from the Processional Way are in various other museums around the world. A reproduction of the gate was built in Iraq as the entrance to a museum that was never completed. Damage to the gate has supposedly occurred since the Iraq war.</English>

Son nom cultuel est "Ishtar Sakipat Tebisha", ou "Ishtar est victorieuse de ses ennemis". La porte est construite selon le principe de la double porte, c'est--dire qu'il y a un mur extrieur et un mur intrieur. La premire porte (intrieure) fait 28m de large, 11m de long et est flanque de deux tours de part et d'autre du passage. La seconde porte (extrieure) est la plus grande. Elle est encastre dans le rempart intrieur, et est flanque de deux tours de 9,50m de haut. Entre les deux tours se trouve une cour ouverte. Il y a eu diffrentes phases de constructions pour la porte d'Ishtar, qui ont chaque fois modifi son dcor : La premire phase est caractrise par un dcor maill, et la dernire par des bas-reliefs en brique maille et colore. Sur les murs des portes, on trouve des ranges de taureau et de dragons. Le taureau symbolise le dieu Adad (dieu de l'orage). Le dragon est une crature hybride : une queue et un corps de serpent, les pattes arrires en serres d'aigle. La tte du dragon (Mushkhushu) est une reprsentation du dieu Marduk (et le dragon lui-mme est un attribut du dieu Marduk). On note que le lion d'Ishtar n'est pas prsent dans les reprsentations.

		<English>The Circus Maximus is an ancient arena and mass entertainment venue located in Rome. Situated in the valley between the Aventine and Palatine hills, the location was first utilized for public games and entertainment by the Etruscan kings of Rome.

Plinio el Viejo, en el siglo I, los describe como monumentos honorarios de importancia inusual, erigidos para conmemorar triunfos. En el siglo II los arcos se erig&#237;an para celebrar otros acontecimientos, como el arco de triunfo que queda en Ancona, erigido por una ciudad agradecida para festejar las mejoras de Trajano en su bah&#237;a.

Here politicians met the citizenry to debate policy. Here teachers congregated with their students. Socrates could often be found in the Athenian agora, teaching his philosophy in the streets to anyone who would listen. In short, agoras were the heart and soul of the city-state.[PARAGRAPH:1]The best surviving example of an agora can be found in Athens.

		<English>Modern western drama was created in Greece around 530 BC, evolving from the "dithyramb," a fertility ritual of songs, poems and dances offered to the Greek god Dionysus. An "Odeon" is a large, open-aired structure in which such performances were held. The audience sat in a semicircle of seats around a central paved "dancing square" (orchestra). The first row of seats was reserved for important officials or priests. There was usually an altar dedicated to Dionysus somewhere in the odeon. The "logeion" was a small raised platform where the performers acted (the original dramas had at most three or four actors; the size of the stage would increase as later plays required bigger casts).</English>

Il s'agit d'un rituel de fertilit&#233; compos&#233; de chants, de po&#232;mes et de danses en hommage au dieu grec Dionysos. Les repr&#233;sentations ont lieu dans un "Od&#233;on", &#224; savoir une grande structure en plein air et le public est assis dans des gradins formant un demi-cercle autour d'une "piste de danse" pav&#233;e au centre (l'orchestre).

Le "logeion" est une petite sc&#232;ne sur&#233;lev&#233;e sur laquelle jouent les acteurs (seuls trois ou quatre personnages composent les premi&#232;res trag&#233;dies ; la taille de la sc&#232;ne augmente par la suite pour les pi&#232;ces aux intervenants plus nombreux).</French>

Das gro&#223;e, relativ offene Geb&#228;ude, in dem die Vorf&#252;hrungen stattfanden, wurde "Odeon" genannt.

In der Regel befand sich irgendwo im Odeon ein dem Gott Dionysos geweihter Altar.

		<English>[TAB]The term "Senate Building" refers to the location where government and administration were carried out in the city-states (polis) of ancient Greece. In Athens, the Senate building was located on the "Areopagus," or "Ares' Hill," and it was where the "boule," also known as the "Council of Five Hundred," met to carry out the day-to-day business of running the polis. This council was divided into ten groups of 50, each of which ruled for one tenth of the year. Selection was chosen by lot, and each day a new chairman was also selected by lot to run the Council. A Senate body of some kind was common through the different polis; for example, Sparta possessed a Senate called the "gerousia" made up of old men who had completed their military service to the Spartan state.[PARAGRAPH:1]In this scenario, senate buildings fulfill much the same function as do courthouses in the main game.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Der Begriff "Senatsgeb&#228;ude" beschreibt den Ort, an dem die Regierungs- und Verwaltungsarbeit der antiken griechischen Stadtstaaten ("Polis") ausgef&#252;hrt wurde. In Athen befand sich das Senatsgeb&#228;ude auf dem "Areopag" oder auch "Ares-H&#252;gel" und diente als Tagungsort f&#252;r die "Bule", den "Rat der 500", um &#252;ber tagespolitische Themen der Polis zu debattieren. Die Bule war in zehn Gruppen mit je 50 Mitgliedern unterteilt, von denen jede ein Zehntel des Jahres das Sagen hatte. Die Zuordnung der Mitglieder zu den Gruppen erfolgte per Losverfahren und jeden Tag wurde ebenfalls per Losverfahren ein neuer oberster Ratsherr bestimmt, der die Ratsversammlung leitete. In den verschiedenen Polis waren Ratsversammlungen beliebiger Art durchaus &#252;blich. So gab es in Sparta zum Beispiel einen &#196;ltestenrat namens "Gerusia", der sich ausschlie&#223;lich aus M&#228;nnern zusammensetzte, die ihren staatlichen Milit&#228;rdienst bereits absolviert hatten.

		<English>[TAB]At the onset of the Peloponnesian War, Athens possessed a formidable defensive structure known as the "Long Walls." Completed in 457 BC, the Long Walls connected Athens with its port city of Piraeus and ensured that the city could not be cut off from supplies unless it was defeated at sea. Lacking effective siege technology the Spartans were unable to breach these walls; they did not achieve final victory until they destroyed the Athenian navy in 404 BC, cutting off Athen's supplies and starving the city into submission.[PARAGRAPH:1]The city of Thebes possessed an ancient and powerful set of fortifications known as the "Cadmea." During 457-447 BC Thebes was engaged in a bitter struggle with its traditional foe Athens. Though the powerful Athenian army overran the Theban countryside, it was never able to breach Thebes's potent defenses and engage the enemy army directly.[PARAGRAPH:1]In this scenario, high walls take much longer to construct than ordinary city walls, but once built they are very difficult for an enemy force to occupy and grant a huge defensive bonus to any units stationed inside.</English>

		<English>The temple was where sacrifices were made, mostly animal but occasionally human. Generally, the Scandinavians did not construct buildings for their Norse religion. Religious ceremonies could take place in a natural location, like a sacred grove, or at home on a simple altar of piled stones called a "horgr." However, there were also a few more important locations for the religion, the most notable being the Temple at Uppsala. Located somewhere near modern Uppsala, Sweden, legends relate that the temple was built by the god Frey, who settled in the area. A large tree with wide branches was said to stand next to the temple, and a golden chain hung around the building's gables. Inside the temple, which was decorated with gold, stood three statues, one for each of the gods Thor, Odin, and Frey. (It should be stressed, however, that this was not a typical temple and most places of worship for the Norse religion were extremely simple.) The Uppsala Temple was eventually destroyed in 1087 AD during the last battle between the pagan Norse and the followers of Christianity.</English>
		<French>Le temple est le lieu consacr&#233; aux sacrifices rituels. On y sacrifiait principalement des animaux mais parfois des &#234;tres humains subissaient ce sort. En r&#232;gle g&#233;n&#233;rale, les peuples scandinaves ne construisaient pas d'&#233;difices pour honorer leurs dieux. Les c&#233;r&#233;monies religieuses pouvaient se d&#233;rouler en pleine nature, comme un bosquet sacr&#233;, ou dans le cadre domestique sur un simple autel de pierres empil&#233;es appel&#233; "horgr". Toutefois, quelques emplacements sacr&#233;s existaient tel que le temple d'Uppsala, situ&#233; pr&#232;s de l'actuelle Uppsala en Su&#232;de. La l&#233;gende dit que le temple fut &#233;rig&#233; par le dieu Freyr lui-m&#234;me et que celui-ci &#233;lut domicile pr&#232;s du site. Ce temple poss&#233;dait des g&#226;bles orn&#233;s d'une cha&#238;ne d'or, et pr&#232;s de l'&#233;difice s'&#233;levait un arbre majestueux aux branches imposantes. A l'int&#233;rieur du temple, d&#233;cor&#233; d'or, se tenaient les statues des dieux Thor, Odin et Freyr. Cette magnificence &#233;tait rare, rappelons que la plupart des lieux de culte de la religion nordique se caract&#233;risaient par leur simplicit&#233;. Le temple d'Uppsala fut d&#233;truit en 1087 pendant la derni&#232;re bataille livr&#233;e entre les pa&#239;ens nordiques et les adeptes de la foi chr&#233;tienne.</French>
		<German>Der Tempel diente unter anderem als Schauplatz f&#252;r Opferungszeremonien. Meist wurden hier Tieropfer, gelegentlich aber auch Menschenopfer dargebracht. Im Allgemeinen errichteten die Skandinavier keine Geb&#228;ude, um ihre nordische Religion zu praktizieren. Glaubensgerichtete Zeremonien wurden h&#228;ufig an naturbelassenen Standorten abgehalten, wie zum Beispiel auf geheiligten Hainen, oder zu Hause an einem einfachen Altar, dem so genannten "H&#246;rgr", der aus aufgeh&#228;uften Steinen bestand. Dar&#252;ber hinaus gab es aber noch einige andere bedeutende religi&#246;se Orte, allen voran den Tempel von Uppsala in Schweden. Der Legende nach soll er von der G&#246;ttin Freya errichtet worden sein, die in dieser Region lebte. Um die Giebel wand sich eine goldene Kette und neben dem Geb&#228;ude stand ein gro&#223;er Baum mit ausladenden &#228;sten. Im Innern gab es eindrucksvolle Goldverzierungen und es waren drei Statuen aufgestellt, je eine f&#252;r die Gottheiten Thor, Odin und Freya. (Hierbei kann es sich allerdings nicht um einen typischen Tempel gehandelt haben, denn die meisten St&#228;tten, an denen die nordische Religion praktiziert wurde, waren extrem schlicht gehalten.) Der Tempel von Uppsala wurde im Jahr 1087 nach Christus w&#228;hrend des letzten Gefechts zwischen den heidnischen Nordm&#228;nnern und den Anh&#228;ngern des Christentums zerst&#246;rt.</German>

Secondo la leggenda il tempio fu costruito dal dio Frey, che si era stabilito nella zona. Si diceva che accanto al tempio vi fosse un albero dai grandi rami e che intorno ai timpani del tempio fosse appesa una catena d'oro. All'interno del tempio, decorato con oro, vi erano tre statue, per gli dei Thor, Odino e Frey (va detto per che questo non era un tipico tempio nordico: i luoghi di culto erano invece estremamente semplici). Il Tempio di Uppsala alla fine fu distrutto nel 1087 d.C. nel corso dell'ultima battaglia tra gli Scandinavi pagani e i seguaci del cristianesimo.</Italian>

		<English>With the beginning of Phoenician and Greek colonization of the Mediterranean the tendency became general accepted to found cities at the sea. Beside of commercial interests the selection of areas was determined by security interest, since the defence of a city was easier in a natural bay e.g. with walls between the promontories. With the development of these coastal cities trade and naval ports were created and complex forms of configurations were found, which culminated in famous buildings like the Colossus of Rhodes and the lighthouse of Alexandria.</English>

The chariot, driven by a charioteer, was used for ancient warfare during the Bronze and Iron Ages, armor being provided by shields. The vehicle continued to be used for travel, processions and in games and races after it had been superseded for military purposes.

Sol&#237;an llevar un palo dirigido hacia adelante y en su proa ten&#237;an emblemas o figuras simb&#243;licas como mascarones. Un solo tipo de nave de guerra fue la protagonistas de las victorias griegas en el mar: el trirreme. Su arqueo era de 100 toneladas y la tripulaban 200 hombres. Med&#237;a 35 metros de eslora y 4 metros de manga. Ten&#237;a 24 remos largos por banda, tim&#243;n doble y una vela cuadrada. En el amplio puente llevaba todo tipo de medios ofensivos.

		<English>This technology marks the transition to more efficient weapons in late ancient times. By the development of new manufacturing processes it was possible to make more resistant weapons. This incident is proved by conserved weapons as well by references in myths of the late ancient times and the Early Middle Ages. Thus the blacksmith Wayland in an old Germanic legend succeeds in forging a particularly hard sword by feeding geese with iron splinters and taking out of their excrements the iron again, which had absorbed the nitrogen contained in the goose excrement and thus had become harder.</English>

		<English>A shortsword is a single-handed sword with a short blade and an overall length between 40 and 80 cm. Compared with longer swords it is more economical in the production, due to the shorter blade less bulky and in combat better to handle. There are clearly advantages over longer swords in a combat situation under cramped conditions, for example in combat with close formations, in small areas or in a dense forest. Variants of the shortsword are the Egypt scimitar, the Persian scimitar, the Greek kopis, the Iberian falcate and the Roman gladius.</English>

		<Spanish>El primer resto arqueol&#243;gico que se tiene de una batalla prehist&#243;rica es de hace 12.000-14.000 a&#241;os, en el Nilo sudan&#233;s, en un &#225;rea conocida como cementerio 117. Un largo n&#250;mero de cuerpos, muchos con puntas de flecha incrustadas en sus esqueletos indica que podr&#237;an ser las bajas de una batalla. Mucho de lo que conocemos de la historia antigua es la de sus militares: sus conquistas, sus movimientos, y sus innovaciones tecnol&#243;gicas. Hay muchas razones por lo que esto sea as&#237;. Reinos e imperios, las unidades centrales de control del mundo antiguo, las cuales solo podr&#237;an haberse mantenido con la fuerza militar. Debido a la limitada habilidad agricultora, solo hab&#237;an unas pocas &#225;reas que pudiesen soportar grandes comunidades humanas, por lo que luchar por &#233;stas era com&#250;n. Las Armas y armaduras, dise&#241;adas para ser robustas, tend&#237;an a durar m&#225;s que otros artefactos, y por ello la gran mayor&#237;a de artefactos recuperados son de este tipo. Las armas y armaduras tambi&#233;n fueron producidas a gran escala por lo que son m&#225;s propensas a encontrarse en excavaciones arqueol&#243;gicas. Sin embargo, las partes m&#225;s perecederas como la madera de las lanzas, no suelen dejar restos. Estos objetos eran considerados signos de posteridad o virtud, y por ello se encuentran en tumbas y monumentos de nobles guerreros. Y la escritura, cuando esta fue inventada, fue usada por los reyes para escribir sus conquistas militares y victorias.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los escritos de la gente com&#250;n, tambi&#233;n tend&#237;an a referirse a los &#233;xitos y fracasos militares. Cuanto mayor fuese la batalla y la conquista, m&#225;s posible era la escritura de un poema &#233;pico para recordarla, como los poemas de Homero referentes a la Guerra de Troya, o canciones u obras de arte. Con el crecimiento de las naciones e imperios, tambi&#233;n aumentaron las necesidades de orden y eficiencia y por ello una mayor variedad de escritos, sobre todo log&#237;sticos, aparecieron.</Spanish>

		<English>A catapult (Greek kata, "against", and pultos, "hurl") is a device used to throw or hurl a projectile a great distance by means of mechanical energy. Its origin is assumed to be in the Greek city Syracuse in the 4th century BC. First they were used as "katapeltikon" for shooting arrows, than they were developed to shoot stones. Catapults were predominantly weapons for sieges, which weren't carried in the army, but could be built everywhere by the wide distribution of wood.</English>

		<German>Das Katapult (griech. kata, "gegen", und pultos, "schleudern") bezeichnet eine gro&#223;e, nicht tragbare Fernwaffe, welche Geschosse mittels mechanischer Energie aus dem ruhenden Zustand stark beschleunigt. Die Entstehung wird im griechischen Syrakus zur Zeit des Dionysios I. im 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. vermutet. Zuerst als "katapeltikon" zum Abschie&#223;en von Pfeilen benutzt, entwickelte sich dann die Technik zum Abschie&#223;en von Steinen. Katapulte waren vorwiegend Belagerungswaffen, die meist nicht in der Armee mitgef&#252;hrt wurden, sondern durch die breite Verf&#252;gbarkeit von Holz &#252;berall neu gebaut werden konnten.</German>

		<Spanish>Tambi&#233;n se conoce a estos aparatos con el nombre latino velopoietica. Los modelos m&#225;s grandes estaban montados sobre fuertes plataformas de madera; el gatillo o impulsor de este tipo de ballesta se tensaba mediante cuerdas hasta quedar sujeto con un gancho. Otro tipo de catapulta aplicaba el principio de torsi&#243;n para lanzar piedras u objetos pesados sobre murallas y fosos: unas cuerdas enrolladas con tornos para echar hacia atr&#225;s el mecanismo impulsor. Tambi&#233;n se utilizaban catapultas m&#225;s peque&#241;as, que eran port&#225;tiles. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las catapultas m&#225;s primitivas dispon&#237;an de un brazo con forma de cuchara en el para situar y lanzar el proyectil, pero las &#250;ltimas versiones antes de la aparici&#243;n de la p&#243;lvora usaban una honda para lanzar el proyectil.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El tipo m&#225;s eficaz de catapulta era el trabuquete, que funcionaba mediante la fuerza de la gravedad. Un contrapeso se izaba mediante unas cuerdas, y una vez situado el proyectil, se soltaban las cuerdas y el contrapeso, m&#225;s pesado que dicho proyectil, lo lanzaba.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las primeras catapultas fueron en forma de una enorme resortera o honda planeada por Alejandro Magno y sus ingenieros para poder derribar las murallas del imperio persa.

		<Spanish>Las zonas de mayor actividad de los piratas coincid&#237;an con las de mayor tr&#225;fico de mercanc&#237;as y de personas. Las primeras referencias hist&#243;ricas sobre la pirater&#237;a datan del siglo V a. C., en la llamada Costa de los piratas, en el Golfo P&#233;rsico. Su actividad se mantuvo durante toda la Antig&#252;edad. Otras zonas afectadas fueron el Mar Mediterr&#225;neo y el Mar de la China Meridional.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aunque los datos no son muy abundantes, por los mitos sabemos que los griegos cl&#225;sicos fueron buenos piratas. Uno de los m&#225;s famosos fue Jas&#243;n, quien guio a los Argonautas hasta La C&#243;lquida en busca del Vellocino de oro, lo que, aunque no entre en la definici&#243;n espa&#241;ola de pirater&#237;a, para algunos es, sin ning&#250;n g&#233;nero de dudas, un acto de pirater&#237;a (personas que vienen por mar para robar).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tambi&#233;n Ulises u Odiseo, seg&#250;n las traducciones griega o latina, realiz&#243; varios actos de pirater&#237;a en su regreso a &#205;taca, como narra Homero en la Odisea.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Con estos dos ejemplos podemos ver una constante que se repetir&#225; a lo largo de los siglos. Los piratas son, en muchas ocasiones, considerados h&#233;roes nacionales en sus pa&#237;ses, pese a practicar lo que en tierra se llamar&#237;a robo y secuestro. Especialmente en una sociedad como la griega, donde el oficio de las armas era reconocido y estimado, un motivo que llevaba a glorificar, en lugar de denostar, actos como el citado de Jas&#243;n. Debe tenerse en cuenta que el oficio de mercenario, si bien es verdad que es llevado a cabo en tierra, no ten&#237;a connotaciones negativas como las tiene actualmente.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Uno de los piratas griegos m&#225;s famosos de los que s&#237; se tienen referencias fue Plutarco de Samos, quien en el siglo VI a. C. saque&#243; toda Asia Menor en diferentes expediciones y lleg&#243; a reunir m&#225;s de 100 barcos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tambi&#233;n los egipcios consideraban piratas a los Pueblos del Mar porque su principal expedici&#243;n invasiva se dio por v&#237;a mar&#237;tima y con la finalidad de efectuar saqueos. Sin embargo, muchos otros autores no comparten esta clasificaci&#243;n porque los Pueblos del Mar s&#243;lo fueron marineros en el &#250;ltimo momento de su historia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la &#233;poca final de la Rep&#250;blica, los piratas en el Mediterr&#225;neo llegaron a convertirse en un peligro, desde sus bases primero al sur de Asia Menor en las monta&#241;osas costas de Cilicia y m&#225;s tarde por todo el Mediterr&#225;neo, puesto que imped&#237;an el comercio e interrump&#237;an las l&#237;neas de suministro de Roma.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A diferencia de siglos posteriores, los piratas de la Antig&#252;edad no buscaban tanto joyas y metales preciosos como personas. Las sociedades de aquella &#233;poca sol&#237;an ser en su mayor&#237;a esclavistas, y la captura de personas para ser vendidas como esclavos resultaba una pr&#225;ctica altamente lucrativa. Pero tambi&#233;n se buscaban piedras preciosas, metales preciosos, esencias, telas, sal, tintes, vino y otros tipos de mercanc&#237;as que sol&#237;an transportarse en los barcos mercantes, caso de los fenicios.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Uno de los casos m&#225;s conocidos de pirater&#237;a contra las l&#237;neas de navegaci&#243;n lo protagoniz&#243; Julio C&#233;sar, que lleg&#243; a ser prisionero de los piratas cilicios (75 a. C.). Plutarco en Vidas paralelas cuenta que el jefe cilicio estimaba el rescate en 20 talentos de oro, a lo que el joven C&#233;sar le espet&#243;: &#191;Veinte? Si conocieras tu negocio, sabr&#237;as que valgo por lo menos 50. El cautiverio dur&#243; 38 d&#237;as, en los cuales el reh&#233;n amenaz&#243; a sus captores con crucificarlos. Finalmente el rescate se pag&#243; y el futuro c&#243;nsul de Roma fue liberado. Pero C&#233;sar cumpli&#243; su amenaza, y cuando recobr&#243; la libertad organiz&#243; una expedici&#243;n, pagada con su propio dinero, durante la que apres&#243; a sus captores y los crucific&#243; a todos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La pirater&#237;a, sobre todo la perpetrada por piratas cilicios, alcanz&#243; niveles preocupantes para Roma hacia el final de la Rep&#250;blica. En el 67 a. C., el senado romano nombr&#243; a Pompeyo proc&#243;nsul de los mares, lo que significaba que se le otorg&#243; el mando supremo del Mare Nostrum (el Mar Mediterr&#225;neo) y de sus costas hasta 75 km mar adentro. Se le concedieron todos los ej&#233;rcitos que se encontrasen a las costas del Mediterr&#225;neo, contando as&#237; con unos 150.000 efectivos, as&#237; como el derecho de tomar del tesoro la cantidad que necesitase. Finalmente, se le provey&#243; con una flota bien pertrechada. En diversas operaciones elimin&#243; en cuarenta d&#237;as a todos los piratas de Sicilia e Italia y, tras el asedio y toma de Coracesion, a los piratas de Cilicia, acabando as&#237;, en cuarenta y nueve d&#237;as, con los piratas de la zona oriental del Mediterr&#225;neo. Asimismo debe apuntarse que dichos piratas s&#243;lo presentaron la resistencia imprescindible para poder solicitar una rendici&#243;n honrosa.</Spanish>

		<Spanish>El origen de la alquimia occidental puede situarse en el Antiguo Egipto. La metalurgia y el misticismo estaban inexorablemente unidas en el mundo antiguo. La alquimia, la medicina e incluso la magia eran aspectos de la religi&#243;n en el Antiguo Egipto y, por tanto, del dominio de la clase sacerdotal. Seg&#250;n la tradici&#243;n egipcia, el fara&#243;n Keops fue el m&#225;s antiguo alquimista y el autor del primer tratado de alquimia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La alquimia egipcia es conocida principalmente a trav&#233;s de los escritos de antiguos fil&#243;sofos griegos (hel&#233;nicos), que a su vez han perdurado a menudo s&#243;lo en traducciones isl&#225;micas. Pr&#225;cticamente no se ha conservado ning&#250;n documento egipcio original sobre la alquimia. Estos escritos, si existieron, probablemente se perdieron cuando el emperador Diocleciano orden&#243; la quema de libros alqu&#237;micos tras sofocar una revuelta en Alejandr&#237;a (292), que hab&#237;a sido un centro de alquimia egipcia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]No obstante, recientes expediciones arqueol&#243;gicas han desenterrado evidencias de an&#225;lisis qu&#237;mico durante los periodos Naqada. Por ejemplo, una herramienta de cobre fechada en esta &#233;poca tiene rastros de haber sido usada de esta forma.3 Adem&#225;s, el proceso de curtir pieles animales ya se conoc&#237;a en el Egipto predin&#225;stico en tiempos tan antiguos como el VI milenio a. C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Otras evidencias indican claramente que los primitivos alquimistas del Antiguo Egipto hab&#237;an ideado pastas de yeso ya en el 4000 a. C., morteros cimentantes hacia el 2500 a. C. y el vidrio en el 1500 a. C. La reacci&#243;n qu&#237;mica implicada en la producci&#243;n del &#243;xido de calcio es una de la m&#225;s antiguas conocidas: CaCO3 + calor &#8658; CaO + CO2 En el Antiguo Egipto se produjeron cosm&#233;ticos, fayenza y tambi&#233;n pez para la construcci&#243;n naval. El papiro tambi&#233;n hab&#237;a sido inventado hacia el 3000 a. C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Un concepto muy importante introducido en esta &#233;poca, concebido por Emp&#233;docles y desarrollado por Arist&#243;teles, fue que todas las cosas del universo estaban formadas por s&#243;lo cuatro elementos: tierra, aire, agua y fuego. Seg&#250;n Arist&#243;teles, cada elemento ten&#237;a una esfera a la que pertenec&#237;a y a la que regresar&#237;a si se le dejaba intacto (Lindsay, p. 16).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los cuatro elementos de los griegos eran aspectos mayoritariamente cualitativos de la materia y no cuantitativos como lo son nuestros elementos modernos. ... La aut&#233;ntica alquimia nunca trat&#243; la tierra, el aire, el agua y el fuego como sustancias corp&#243;reas o qu&#237;micas en el sentido actual de la palabra. Los cuatro elementos era simplemente las cualidades primarias y m&#225;s generales por medio de las cuales la sustancia amorfa y puramente cuantitativa de todos los cuerpos se presentaba primero en una forma diferenciada. (Hitchcock, p. 66) Alquimistas posteriores desarrollaron extensivamente los aspectos m&#237;sticos de este concepto.[NEWLINE]</Spanish>

		<English>The earliest spears were actually just simple, sharpened wooden sticks. Then the people of the early Stone Age discovered that the tips could also be hardened in fire. While the spearheads of the older Stone Age were still relatively roughly hewn, they became finer and more elegant over time and developed into real designer pieces in the Neolithic Age, which are still impressive in form and aesthetics today.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the beginning of the Bronze Age (in Central Europe around 2200 BC), spearheads were finally made of metal and used by all important peoples from then on. From 500 BC Iron spear and lance tips increasingly appeared.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In ancient times, this weapon was then in heavy use, e.g. B. by Greeks by Peltasts, by Romans as Pilum or by Germans as Ango, Frame and Ger.</English>

		<English>Axes belong beside arrow and bow to the oldest weapons of mankind. The oldest axes were so-called hand axes made of stone. The first axes used as weapons were probably also used as tools because they were readily available. Finally, the development of specific weapon axes was started. Despite this, the normal axes continued to be used and continued into our time. An ax made specifically for combat use is called a battle axe.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In North- and East Europe battle axes were widely spreaded around the time 2200 BC. By the Celts, the Germanic tribes and the other people of the ancient world battle axes were used mainly by warriors, who couldn't afford a sword, but at the same time they were often a status symbol of leaders. Battle axes existed as weapons of horsemen and foot soldiers. According to civilisation they had different length and amplitude. Battle axes consisted of stone, bronze, iron and steel.</English>

		<Spanish>La viticultura (del lat&#237;n vitis, "vid") es el cultivo sistem&#225;tico de la vid, o parra, para usar sus uvas en la producci&#243;n de vino. Es una rama de la ciencia de la horticultura.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La historia del vino se ha entrelazado con la historia de otras actividades humanas como pueda ser la agricultura, la gastronom&#237;a, las actividades l&#250;dicas de las civilizaciones, as&#237; como del devenir del hombre mismo. El vino es una bebida alcoh&#243;lica fermentada procedente del zumo de la uva (Vitis vinifera) que contiene alcohol et&#237;lico y que en cantidades moderadas nos provoca la expresi&#243;n sincera de sentimientos, mientras que en grandes cantidades se trata de un narc&#243;tico. La naturaleza humana ha estado, desde sus comienzos, sedienta de vino y esto ha provocado que sea una mercanc&#237;a de valor en diferentes culturas. Existen evidencias arqueol&#243;gicas en las que se indica que la producciones de vino m&#225;s antiguas provienen de una extensa &#225;rea que abarca: Georgia (v&#233;ase: Vino de Georgia) e Ir&#225;n (Montes Zagros), datando estos comienzos en el periodo que va desde el 6000 al 5000 a. C. Los primeros cultivos de la uva (vitis vinifera) ocurrieron en la edad del bronce en lugares cercanos al Oriente Pr&#243;ximo, Sumeria y Antiguo Egipto alrededor del tercer milenio a. C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Muchas de las grandes culturas del mediterr&#225;neo as&#237; como Oriente Pr&#243;ximo reclaman haber inventado ellos mismos el proceso de vinificaci&#243;n atribuyendo su descubrimiento a un h&#233;roe local o a una divinidad agraria. Pero el caso es que el comercio y la expansi&#243;n de algunas culturas e imperios ha hecho que el vino y su cultivo se fuese extendiendo por diversas regiones de la Tierra, adoptando nuevos sabores y aromas. El vino (al igual que otros alimentos b&#225;sicos) aparece en la cultura cargado de simbolismo. El vino aparece en la Biblia (Libro del G&#233;nesis) tras el Diluvio universal replantado por No&#233; (del que la tradici&#243;n judeo-cristiana aclama como inventor del vino), aunque puede establecerse un paralelismo con No&#233; en el personaje del poema de Gilgamesh (narraci&#243;n de origen sumerio) denominado Utnapishtim que igualmente planta vi&#241;as tras un diluvio. En las diversas culturas de la tierra existen otras bebidas fermentadas similares, como puede ser la hidromiel y la sidra de los pueblos del Norte de Europa, el koumiss del Asia Central, los mismos romanos fermentaron higos y d&#225;tiles para hacer bebidas alcoh&#243;licas. La capacidad adaptativa de la uva a diferentes climas y suelos, su alto rendimiento, es la &#250;nica fruta que retiene en su interior cantidades de un inusual &#225;cido denominado tart&#225;rico que favorece la acci&#243;n de las levaduras. Se puede decir que en la actualidad la uva es la fruta m&#225;s recolectada a nivel mundial, siendo el 70% de la misma dedicado a la producci&#243;n de vino.</Spanish>

		<German>Schamanismus ist die &#228;lteste unter den religi&#246;senen Vorstellungen und ist schon f&#252;r die mittlere Steinzeit arch&#228;ologisch nachweisbar. In der Antike war der Schamanismus besonders bei den Hunnen und Skythen pr&#228;sent. Im Schamanimus wird zwischen einer profanen, diesseitigen Welt der Menschen und einer sakralen, jenseitigen Welt der Seelen, Geister und Ahnen unterschieden. Dieses Grundkonzept hat praktisch alle historischen und aktuellen Religionen beeinflusst. Bis heute schreiben viele Naturreligionen Schamanen die F&#228;higkeit zu, in ekstatischen Bewusstseinszust&#228;nden in Kontakt mit dem Jenseits zu kommen.</German>

		<Spanish>El t&#233;rmino chamanismo se refiere a un grupo de creencias y pr&#225;cticas tradicionales preocupadas por la comunicaci&#243;n con el mundo de los esp&#237;ritus. El practicante del chamanismo es conocido como cham&#225;n.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El chamanismo es considerado por algunos como el antecedente de todas las religiones organizadas, ya que naci&#243; antes del Neol&#237;tico. Alguna de sus aspectos se mantienen en el fondo de estas religiones, generalmente en sus pr&#225;cticas m&#237;sticas y simb&#243;licas. El paganismo griego estaba influenciado por el chamanismo, como se refleja en las historias de T&#225;ntalo, Prometeo, Medea y Calipso entre otros, as&#237; como en los misterios, como los de Eleusis.

Los antiguos romanos emplearon tierras o cenizas volc&#225;nicas, conocidas tambi&#233;n como puzolana, que contienen s&#237;lice y al&#250;mina, que al combinarse qu&#237;micamente con la cal daban como resultado el denominado cemento puzol&#225;nico (obtenido en Pozzuoli, cerca del Vesubio). A&#241;adiendo en su masa jarras cer&#225;micas o materiales de baja densidad (piedra p&#243;mez) obtuvieron el primer hormig&#243;n aligerado. Con este material se construyeron desde tuber&#237;as a instalaciones portuarias, cuyos restos a&#250;n perduran. Destacan construcciones como los diversos arcos del Coliseo romano, los nervios de la b&#243;veda de la Bas&#237;lica de Majencio, con luces de m&#225;s de 25 metros, las b&#243;vedas de las Termas de Caracalla, y la c&#250;pula del Pante&#243;n de Agripa, de unos 43 metros de di&#225;metro, la de mayor luz durante siglos.</Spanish>

		<English>The ballista, sometimes called bolt thrower, was an ancient missile weapon that launched either bolts or stones at a distant target. Developed from earlier Greek weapons, it relied upon different mechanics, using two levers with torsion springs instead of a tension prod. The early ballistae in Ancient Greece were developed from two weapons called oxybeles and gastraphetes. The Romans inherited the torsion-powered ballista. The torsion ballista, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor and the Romans developed it even further, especially into much smaller versions, that could be easily carried. The carroballista was a cart-mounted version of the weapon. The scorpio is a torsion catapult powered by torsion springs, a kind of ballista. Scorpions could be designed to shoot stones or arrow-shaped missiles of various sizes</English>

		<Spanish>Por lo general, la balista se constru&#237;a en madera, aunque pod&#237;a tener partes hechas o al menos revestidas de metal, y usaba cuerdas, tendones de animales o crines como tensores. Desarrollado a partir de armas de la &#233;poca de la Grecia cl&#225;sica anteriores, se basaba en diferentes mec&#225;nicas y utilizaba dos palancas que ofrec&#237;an una energ&#237;a potencial mediante las cuerdas o tendones trenzados en forma de madejas retorcidas. La carrobalista era una m&#225;quina de guerra romana que consist&#237;a en una balista montada sobre un carro arrastrado por caballos o mulas para ser m&#225;s adecuadamente transportada a distintos lugares en una misma acci&#243;n.

		<English>The first use of horses in warfare occurred over 5000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses ridden in warfare dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000 BC. A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500 BC depicts some type of equine pulling wagons. By 1600 BC, improved harness and chariot designs made chariot warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350 BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360 BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including the invention of the saddle, the stirrup, and later, the horse collar. Many different types and sizes of horses were used in war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply. Throughout history, mules and donkeys as well as horses played a crucial role in providing support to armies in the field.</English>

		<Spanish>Uno de los primeros ejemplos del empleo del caballo en batalla fueron los arqueros o arrojadores de lanzas montados, que datan de la &#233;poca de los reyes asirios Asurnasirpal II y Salmanasar III. No obstante, los jinetes se sentaban en la parte posterior de sus caballos, una posici&#243;n inc&#243;moda para movimientos r&#225;pidos; por esto, los caballos sol&#237;an ser sostenidos por alguien de a pie que permit&#237;a al arquero la libertad para disparar. Por lo tanto, era m&#225;s bien una infanter&#237;a montada que verdadera caballer&#237;a.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los asirios desarrollaron el uso de la caballer&#237;a como respuesta ante las invasiones de los pueblos n&#243;madas del norte, como por ejemplo los cimerios, quienes entraron en Asia Menor en el siglo VIII a. C. y se adue&#241;aron de partes de Urartu durante el reinado de Sarg&#243;n II, aproximadamente en 721 a. C. Guerreros montados como los escitas tambi&#233;n tuvieron influencia sobre la regi&#243;n durante el siglo VII a. C. Al momento del reinado de Asurbanipal en el 669 a. C., los asirios ya hab&#237;an aprendido a sentarse m&#225;s adelante en sus caballos, en la posici&#243;n cl&#225;sica de montura que a&#250;n puede observarse en la actualidad y que podr&#237;a denominarse como verdadera caballer&#237;a ligera. Los antiguos griegos emplearon tanto caballos ligeros para explorar, como caballer&#237;a pesada.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se cree que la caballer&#237;a pesada fue desarrollada por los antiguos persas. En &#233;pocas de Dar&#237;o I (558-486 a. C.), las t&#225;cticas militares persas evolucionaron al punto de requerir caballos y jinetes con armaduras completas, por lo que se crio un tipo de caballo m&#225;s pesado y musculoso que pudiera soportar este peso adicional. Tiempo despu&#233;s, los antiguos griegos crearon una caballer&#237;a pesada con armadura, cuyas unidades m&#225;s famosas son los hetairoi de Alejandro Magno. Los chinos del siglo IV a. C., durante el per&#237;odo de los Reinos Combatientes (403 a. C.-221 a. C.), comenzaron a emplear la caballer&#237;a contra los reinos rivales. Adem&#225;s, en respuesta a los ataques de jinetes n&#243;madas del norte y el oeste, los chinos de la Dinast&#237;a Han (202 a. C.-220 d.

They were literally "foot companions" (in Greek the pezos means "foot warrior" or "infantryman", and hetairos means "companion" or "friend"). The Macedonian phalanxes were made up almost entirely of pezhetairoi. Pezhetairoi were very effective against both enemy cavalry and infantry, as their long pikes could be used to impale enemies charging on horse-back or to keep enemy infantry with shorter weapons at bay. They were armed with the sarissa, a long spear with a shaft made from flexible cornel wood, which had a much longer reach than the traditional hoplite spear. Because of its length the phalanx could present the spearpoints of around five files of men; which made the phalanx almost impenetrable, and fearsome to oppose.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Los pezhetairoi eran la columna vertebral del ej&#233;rcito macedonio. Formaban la compa&#241;&#237;a de a pie (en griego, p&#233;zos significa soldado de a pie, infante, y hetairos, compa&#241;ero o amigo).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las falanges griegas estaban formadas casi por entero de pezhetairoi. &#201;stos eran especialmente eficaces contra la caballer&#237;a enemiga, pues con sus largas picas (llamadas sarissas) pod&#237;an empalar a los enemigos que iban a caballo. Durante la guerra de Alejandro Magno contra Persia se precis&#243; m&#225;s caballer&#237;a de la habitual, as&#237; que la caballer&#237;a de compa&#241;eros (hetairoi) tambi&#233;n empez&#243; a surgir alrededor de esta &#233;poca.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los pezhetairoi eran los batallones de la falange macedonia. Empezaron a destacar durante el reinado de Filipo II, especialmente tras tener un papel muy importante en la Batalla de Queronea (338 a. C.), asegurando el domino del arg&#233;ada sobre Grecia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La sarissa era el arma principal de los pezhetairoi. Se trataba de una larga pica hecha con madera flexible, que era mucho m&#225;s larga que la tradicional lanza de los hoplitas (la media era de seis metros). Por su longitud cubr&#237;a cinco filas de soldados, lo que hizo a la falange impenetrable y temida por sus oponentes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]T&#225;cticamente, &#233;stos eran usados como una gran l&#237;nea defensiva, en vez de como tropas de choque. La longitud de la sarissa, que daba a la falange un aspecto terror&#237;fico, limitaba mucho sus maniobras, y si se les cog&#237;a por el flanco o la retaguardia casi no ten&#237;an oportunidad de responder. Esto mismo ocurri&#243; en la Batalla de Gaugamela (331 a. C.), cuando el r&#225;pido avance del ala derecha hizo que se abriera una brecha entre los dos batallones de pezhetairoi. Entonces una parte de la caballer&#237;a enemiga consigui&#243; penetrar y hubieran acabado con toda la falange desde la retaguardia si no fuera por la falta de disciplina de sus propios comandantes, y por la segunda l&#237;nea de hoplitas que Alejandro hab&#237;a puesto como refuerzo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pero fuera de las grandes batallas, los pezhetairoi y sus sarissas no ten&#237;an mucha utilidad. Posteriormente este cuerpo fue rearmado y se adaptaron sus t&#225;cticas. Con ello se pretend&#237;a hacerlos adecuados para luchar en las guerras de guerrillas de Sogdiana y la Bactria.</Spanish>

Puede hablarse por tanto de arco recurvado moderno (utilizando materiales como metales ligeros, fibra de carbono o de vidrio, etc.) o de recurvado tradicional (&#237;ntegramente hechos de diversas maderas).</Spanish>

		<English>Emigration is the act of leaving one's native country or region to settle in another. It is the same as immigration but from the perspective of the country of origin. Human movement before the establishment of political boundaries or within one state, is termed migration. There are many reasons why people might choose to emigrate. Some are for reasons of religious, political or economic freedom or escape. Others have personal reasons such as marriage. Some people living in rich nations with cold climates choose to move to warmer climates when they retire.</English>

		<English>The Spartiates were the males of Spartais known to the spartans as "peers" or "men of equal status". From a young age, male Spartiates were trained for battle and put through grueling challenges intended to craft them into fearless warriors. In battle, they had the reputation of being the best soldiers in Greece, and the strength of Sparta's hoplite forces let the city become the dominant state in Greece throughout most of the Hellenic period.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since all Spartan males served in the military, there was no higher honor than to be a part of the elite unit known as the 'Hippeis' (singular: Hippeus), who were the King of Sparta's personal bodyguard. This unit was comprised of the 300 best Spartiati warriors who were held in the highest esteem by their fellow citizens in Sparta. These hoplites stood shield-to-shield protecting their king in the phalanx formation alongside with their countrymen. These soldiers were initially mounted, and they would then serve as heavily-armed foot soldiers after some time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hippeis usually consisted of Spartans who were in their early to late twenties in age.

		<German>Spartaner wurden von klein auf trainiert zu t&#246;ten und in den Kampf zu ziehen. F&#252;r einen Mann in Sparta gab es nur das Milit&#228;r. Mit 8 Jahren begann die k&#246;rperliche Ausbildung, mit 14 Jahren erlernte der Spartaner den Umgang mit den Waffen und mit 20 mussten sie entweder, um ihre Ausbildung abzuschlie&#223;en einen Heloten (unfreie Bauer) t&#246;ten oder die J&#252;ngeren trainieren.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Da alle spartanischen M&#228;nner im Milit&#228;r dienten, gab es keine gr&#246;&#223;ere Ehre, als ein Teil der Elite Einheit "Hippeis" (Singular: Hippeus) zu werden, welche die pers&#246;nlichen Leibw&#228;chter des K&#246;nigs von Sparta waren. Diese Einheit bestand aus den 300 besten Spartanern, die die h&#246;chste Wertsch&#228;tzung von ihren Mitb&#252;rgern in Sparta bekamen. Diese Hopliten standen Schild-an-Schild um ihren K&#246;nig in einer Phalanx, gemeinsam mit ihren Landsleuten. Diese Soldaten waren zun&#228;chst beritten, k&#228;mpften aber dann als schwer bewaffnete Fu&#223;soldaten in der Phalanx.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Die Hippeis bestand in der Regel aus 21-29 j&#228;hrigen Spartanern. Allerdings ordnete K&#246;nig Leonidas in der Schlacht bei den Thermopylen, dass ihn nur M&#228;nner mit S&#246;hnen begleiten durften um so zu garantieren, dass diese Blutlinie in der Schlacht nicht ausgel&#246;scht wird. Allerdings ist es h&#246;chst unwahrscheinlich, dass all diese Elite-Krieger einen m&#228;nnlichen Erben hatten.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Folglich kann davon ausgegangen werden, dass die 300 Spartiaten, die bei den Thermopylen im Jahre 480 v.

		<Spanish>En Esparta los h&#243;moioi recib&#237;an esta denominaci&#243;n en raz&#243;n de su te&#243;rica uniformidad social y econ&#243;mica. Son espartiatas los varones mayores de 30 a&#241;os que disfrutan de sus derechos, es decir, los que constituyen el cuerpo c&#237;vico de la ciudad, politeuma. Es un espartiata que ha pasado la agog&#233; y no ha perdido sus derechos por perder su kleros, mostrar cobard&#237;a, cometer delitos o no contribuir en las sisitias. El n&#250;mero de "iguales" fue descendiendo desde el siglo VIII a. C., fen&#243;meno conocido como oligantrop&#237;a.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En un principio, seg&#250;n Plutarco, Licurgo reparti&#243; las tierras entre 9.000 espartiatas. En el periodo cl&#225;sico la cifra se reduce a 8.000. en plena Guerra del Peloponeso vemos que ha disminuido el n&#250;mero de forma significativa hasta llegar apenas a los 2.000. Finalmente tras la Batalla de Leuctra nos encontramos con un n&#250;mero muy escaso, alrededor de 1.000. La oligantrop&#237;a fue debida a la alta mortandad derivada de la situaci&#243;n constante de guerra, el se&#237;smo del 464, homosexualidad extendida, matrimonios tard&#237;os, eugenesia y endogamia. Por &#250;ltimo es muy importante tener en cuenta que tras la Guerra del Peloponeso se enriquecen unos pocos a costa del empobrecimiento general, que ir&#225;n perdiendo la ciudadan&#237;a al tener que vender sus tierras. Se intenta otorgar privilegios a los espartiatas con m&#225;s de tres hijos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los espartiatas convertidos en homoioi pose&#237;an un kl&#234;ros, lote de tierras, y unos hilotas proporcionados por el Estado. As&#237; cada homoios tiene tiempo libre para ejercitarse en el gimnasio e ir de caza. Vest&#237;an con sobriedad y modestia, sin adorno alguno. Era caracter&#237;stico su peinado, una larga cabellera, signo de su condici&#243;n de libertad. Las mujeres y los ni&#241;os deb&#237;an llevarlo corto. Tambi&#233;n era costumbre llevar barba pero rasurarse el bigote. En el campo de batalla visten capas p&#250;rpuras (stola&#237; phoinik&#237;des) que provocaban pavor en el enemigo. Un rito antes de empezar la batalla era untarse el cuerpo en aceite y lustrar sus armas a la vez que peinaban cuidadosamente su pelo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]S&#237; grababan los nombres en las tumbas para destacar la uniformidad social. Las diferencias exist&#237;an, simplemente con ver los arist&#243;cratas llamados kaloikagatho&#237; ("los bellos y buenos") elegidos para la Gerus&#237;a. Tambi&#233;n se distinguen aquellos que han demostrado su valent&#237;a en el campo de batalla o su excelencia en las competiciones atl&#233;ticas. Otra subclase social dentro de los homoioi es la de los llamados hippeis, guardia real, que no tiene nada que ver con su traducci&#243;n como caballeros.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cuando el homoios muere, su kl&#233;ros pasa a los hijos e hijas en calidad igual entre hijos y la mitad a las f&#233;minas. Por esta raz&#243;n, y por aparecer desnudas, recibir formaci&#243;n filos&#243;fica y ejercitarse en los gimnasios, los griegos ve&#237;an escandalizados esta inhabitual libertad. Pero para Esparta la mujer era ante todo la que deb&#237;a engendrar varones fuertes; hasta tal punto se la considera esencial que su muerte en el parto tiene el mismo significado que la kal&#243;s thanatos o muerte heroica en combate.</Spanish>

		<German>Im Feld waren die Pr&#228;torianer jeder Einheit der r&#246;mischen Armee gleichgestellt. Obwohl die Pr&#228;torianer &#196;hnlichkeiten mit den Legionstruppen aufwiesen, gab es doch einige Unterschiede. Ihre Kohorten waren gr&#246;&#223;er, der Sold und die zus&#228;tzlichen Leistungen waren besser, und auf ihr milit&#228;risches Verm&#246;gen war Verlass. Sie erhielten h&#246;here Geldgeschenke (Donativa) von den Kaisern als die regul&#228;ren Truppen. Au&#223;erdem bildeten sich aus den erst reinen Fu&#223;truppen der Pr&#228;torianer auch sehr bald eine Reiterei, die equites singulares.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Die erste Garde, die den Namen nach schon Pr&#228;torianergarde hie&#223;, wurde w&#228;hrend der Belagerung von Numantia von Scipio Aemilianus geschaffen (etwa 138 v. Chr.). Sie war f&#252;nfhundert Mann stark und ihr Name wurde vom Praetorium, dem Zelt des Feldherrn eines Legionslagers, hergeleitet.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bis zum Ende der Republik hatte jeder der r&#246;mischen Feldherrn eine solche Pr&#228;torianergarde. Es war aber Kaiser Augustus (31 v.Chr.-14 n.Chr.) der der Pr&#228;torianergarde jene Gestalt gab, die sie bis zu ihrer endg&#252;ltigen Aufl&#246;sung hatte. Sie bestand nun aus neun Kohorten (etwa 4.500 Mann) und hatte die exklusive Aufgabe, den Kaiser zu sch&#252;tzen. Drei der neun Kohorten wurden direkt in Rom stationiert w&#228;hrend die restlichen Kohorten in St&#228;dten rund um Rom platziert wurden.

		<Spanish>El t&#233;rmino "pretoriano" tiene su origen en la tienda de campa&#241;a del general o praetor de un ej&#233;rcito romano llamada praetorium. Muchos de los generales romanos ten&#237;an la costumbre de escoger entre las filas una fuerza privada de soldados para servir como escoltas (guardias) de la tienda o de la persona del general, y consist&#237;a en una infanter&#237;a y una caballer&#237;a. Durante las guerras civiles aument&#243; el n&#250;mero de los soldados que integraban la Guardia Pretoriana.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Con el pasar del tiempo, esta unidad (cohorte) se lleg&#243; a conocer como la cohors praetoria y varias figuras notables incluyendo Julio C&#233;sar, Marco Antonio y C&#233;sar Augusto tuvieron una. Julio C&#233;sar se dio cuenta que se necesitaba una unidad m&#225;s peligrosa que las dem&#225;s en el campo como la Legi&#243;n X Equestris (o Legio X Gemina). Cuando Augusto se convirti&#243; en el primer gobernante del imperio en el 27 a. C., decidi&#243; que tal formaci&#243;n era &#250;til no solamente en guerra, sino tambi&#233;n en pol&#237;tica. As&#237;, de las filas de las legiones de todas las provincias, Augusto reclut&#243; a la Guardia Pretoriana. El campo ocupado por esta tropa se llam&#243; Castra Praetoria (campamento pretoriano) y su comandante, designado por Augusto, prefecto del pretorio. Este cargo, puramente militar, no tuvo al principio gran importancia, pero la adquiri&#243; en la &#233;poca de Tiberio. Los prefectos del pretorio se convirtieron poco a poco en primeros ministros del emperador. En un principio, hab&#237;a dos prefectos del pretorio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La Guardia Pretoriana (del lat&#237;n: praetoriani) era un cuerpo militar que serv&#237;a de escolta y protecci&#243;n a los emperadores romanos. Antes de los emperadores, esta escolta era usada por los l&#237;deres militares a&#250;n desde los d&#237;as de la familia de los Escipiones alrededor del a&#241;o 275 a. C. Los miembros de la Guardia Pretoriana estaban entre las m&#225;s diestras y c&#233;lebres fuerzas militares de la Historia Antigua.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los soldados de las cohortes pretorianas recib&#237;an doble paga y gozaban de numerosos privilegios.

		<English>War loot refers to goods, valuables and property obtained after a war from occupied territories. The winning army traditionally reserves the "right" to rob and plunder the defeated country and its population, often combined with war rape. Looting during war has been common practice since recorded times. For foot soldiers, it was viewed as a way to supplement their often meager income and vent aggression. On higher levels, leaders of the winning armies, countries and nations did the very same, just in grander style. The proud exhibition of loot was an integral part of the typical Roman triumph, for example. Jenghis Khan was not unusual in proclaiming that the greatest happiness was to vanquish, devastate and rob one's enemies. Not only the enemy's property, but his home, family and person belonged to the victor, who was free to take, enslave or destroy whatever or whomever he wanted.</English>

		<German>Die Kriege der Antike sind unter anderem stark durch die Beteiligung privater Kriegsherren gepr&#228;gt. Neben den rein staatlichen Kriegen zwischen den griechischen Poleis oder anderen damals v&#246;lkerrechtlichen Subjekten kam es sehr h&#228;ufig zu Kriegsz&#252;gen von Privatleuten. Diese operierten v&#246;llig selbstst&#228;ndig (Piraten) oder im staatlichen Auftrag (S&#246;ldner). In beiden F&#228;llen war Kriegsbeute eine wesentliche Einkommensquelle. Insbesondere f&#252;r die ab dem 5. vorchristlichen Jahrhundert vermehrt aufkommenden S&#246;ldner war das Beuteversprechen vor Beginn der Feldz&#252;ge wesentlicher Anreiz und Vertragsbestandteil. Das R&#246;mische Reich schickte hohe Verwaltungsbeamte oder Offiziere(Pr&#228;toren) mit der Zusage von Kriegsbeute in seine nicht befriedeten Kolonien. Die auf der iberischen Halbinsel zwischen 193 und 178 v.Chr eingesetzten Pr&#228;toren f&#252;hrten reine Vernichtungs- und Beutekriege und machten dank ihres dort erworbenen Reichtums und Prestiges gl&#228;nzende Karrieren. Das Versprechen bestimmter Anteile an der Kriegsbeute war aber auch f&#252;r die Legion&#228;re ein entscheidendes Motiv, sich solchen Z&#252;gen nicht zu verweigern, was grunds&#228;tzlich durchaus m&#246;glich war und auch vorkam. Besonders nach erfolgreichen Belagerungen war es &#252;blich, die eroberte Stadt den Soldaten zur Pl&#252;nderung freizugeben. Neben den gew&#246;hnlichen Beutest&#252;cken, wie Edelmetallen oder -steinen und gem&#252;nztem Geld, die auch f&#252;r den Einzelnen leicht zu transportieren sind, wurden vom R&#246;mischen Reich auch in zunehmendem Ma&#223;e Kunstgegenst&#228;nde als Kriegsbeute aus den eroberten Gebieten abtransportiert. Die Einbringung von Sklaven als Kriegsbeute war allgemein normaler Bestandteil der Kriegf&#252;hrung und in etliche F&#228;llen das eigentliche Kriegsziel. Waffen und Ausr&#252;stungsst&#252;cke verloren dementgegen ihre Bedeutung als Kriegsbeute. W&#228;hrend sie in den Kriegen der Griechen noch eine gewisse Rolle spielten, waren sie in der einheitlich ausger&#252;steten r&#246;mischen Armee bestenfalls als "Souvenir" gefragt. Weniger einheitlich ausger&#252;stete Randkulturen ("Barbaren") m&#246;gen aber r&#246;mische Waffen zur Vervollst&#228;ndigung der eigenen Ausr&#252;stung genommen haben.</German>

		<Spanish>Se llama bot&#237;n a los bienes movibles tomados al enemigo por los soldados con el consentimiento de su General.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Entre los pueblos guerreros sumisos a una disciplina severa, el bot&#237;n era un bien p&#250;blico, cuya inversi&#243;n depend&#237;a de la voluntad del Jefe del ej&#233;rcito. La divisi&#243;n de la parte que daba a los soldados se hacia con orden. Entre los Jud&#237;os el gran Sacerdote y los Pr&#237;ncipes del pueblo recib&#237;an todo lo que se hab&#237;a tomado en la guerra, as&#237; de hombres como de bestias y lo divid&#237;an por partes iguales entre aqu&#233;llos que hab&#237;an combatido, el resto de la multitud. Separaban un quinto, tanto de hombres como de bueyes, asnos y ovejas que se tomaba de la porci&#243;n de los combatientes y se enviaba al gran Sacerdote como primicias del Se&#241;or. Tomaban tambi&#233;n de la parte del resto del pueblo un quinto de hombres, de bueyes, de asnos y de ovejas para los Levitas que guardaban el Tabern&#225;culo. En cuanto al resto de los bienes m&#243;viles, lo que cada uno hab&#237;a tomado era suyo; Unusquisque enim quod in praeda rapuerat ipsum erat. Despu&#233;s de la derrota de los Madianitas los Generales y los oficiales particulares del ej&#233;rcito ofrecieron en don al Se&#241;or todos los adornos de oro, como brazales, anillos y collares, que hallaron en el bot&#237;n.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el tiempo de la guerra de Troya los soldados llevaban el bot&#237;n a sus respectivos jefes, que le presentaban al General y &#233;ste hacia la distribuci&#243;n por partes iguales pero se le daba siempre una m&#225;s considerable.[NEWLINE]Los cautivos compon&#237;an parte del bot&#237;n.

Kurzschwertk&#228;mpfer haben meist hergestochen, da das Kurzschwert nicht die Reichweite hatte, um damit wirkungsvoll um sich zu schlagen.</German>

Esta pieza de artiller&#237;a era montada en el lugar del asedio por al menos 8 hombres, sobre una base de tierra aplastada o ladrillos que disminuyera la vibraci&#243;n al ponerse en marcha. Constaba de un marco de madera que serv&#237;a de base en el suelo, sobre el que se alzaba un marco tambi&#233;n de madera (reforzado a veces con pieles) que serv&#237;a de tope al brazo cuando &#233;ste sal&#237;a disparado, evitando as&#237; su rotura.

		<English>The ancient galleys are used here as a collective term for various poly-oared ships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A galley is a type of ship propelled by rowers that originated in the Mediterranean region and was used for warfare, trade and piracy from the first millennium BC. Galleys dominated naval warfare in the Mediterranean Sea from the 8th century BC until development of advanced sailing warships in the 17th century. Galleys fought in the wars of Assyria, ancient Phoenicia, Greece, Carthage and Rome until the 4th century AD. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire galleys formed the mainstay of the Byzantine navy and other navies of successors of the Roman Empire, as well as new Muslim navies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Early galleys usually had between 15 and 30 pairs of oars and were called triaconters or penteconters, literally "thirty-" and "fifty-oared", respectively. By the 8th century BC, the Phoenecians had added a second row of oars to these ships, creating the bireme. Soon after, a third row of oars was added by the addition of an outrigger to the hull of a bireme, a projecting construction that allowed for more room for the projecting oars. These new galleys were called trieres ("three-fitted") in Greek. The Romans later called this design the triremis, trireme, the name it is today best known under. It has been hypothesized that early types of triremes existed in 701 BC, but the earliest positive literary reference dates to 542 BC. According to the Greek historian Herodotos, the first ramming action occurred in 535 BC when 60 Phocaean penteconters fought 120 Etruscan and Carthaginian ships.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The literary evidence indicates that Greek and Roman navies generally preferred to rely on freemen to man their galleys.

A master of cavalry tactics, Alexander would hold them back during the opening part of the battle, committing them at the decisive point to charge the shaken foe, often leading the attack himself. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Alexander's father, Philip of Macedon, created the Companions, who were originally his closest retainers, picked from the Macedonian nobility. As their numbers rose, additional young noblemen were recruited from Thessaly and other parts of the Greek world. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The Companions were organized into "ilai" (wings) of about 200 men, under the command of close personal friends of the king. They generally wore the usual Boeotian helmet with plumes out the top, a dyed cloak and cuirass. Underneath, they wore linen or leather corslets reinforced with metal scales. They carried long thrusting spears and a short sword; few carried shields unless afoot. Occasionally, Alexander armed them with javelins for specific battles. Their mounts were the best that Greece had to offer: short, sturdy animals trained for war. The horses were partially armored, likely with leather skirts over their flanks and rumps. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The legends of Alexander's Companions have grown with the telling over the centuries. Though their prowess has undoubtedly been exaggerated, it cannot be denied that they played a significant role in victorious battles such as Issus and Chaeronea. And their loyalty was never questioned. For the next several centuries, elite cavalry of many ancient kingdoms would take the Companions as their ideal model.</English>

		<English>[TAB]These were a form of light infantry used by the Greeks and Macedonians in the classical period. They often fought as skirmishers. Peltasts were equipped with a small shield known as a pelte, and carried a short pike and sword. Their main weapon, however, was the javelin which was used as a ranged weapon against the more heavily armored hoplite phalanx. Peltasts wore a light helmet and a broad metal belt to protect the abdomen, but were otherwise unarmored. Peltasts were usually drawn from the poorer ranks of society, those people who were unable to afford the expensive equipment of the hoplites. They also often sought work as mercenaries. Peltasts reputedly were from Thrace, but more likely they were drawn from the poorer classes all over Greece. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Peltasts first came into general use during the Peloponnesian War, and many of them were also employed in the campaigns of Alexander. There was usually one peltast for every two hoplites, and they were deployed in ranks of eight behind the heavy infantry for battle. Although they were considered inferior to the hoplites, peltasts served a very important role as lighter, faster-moving infantry forces during the conquests of Alexander.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The "hypaspitai" were elite foot guardsmen in Alexander's Macedonian army. They often fought on the right flank of the "Companion Cavalry," a place of honor in most Greek armies. They were highly mobile for their time, and Alexander used this to great advantage at battles such as Chaeronea in 338 BC. The first hypaspists were raised from the kingdom of Macedonia on a provincial basis by Philip II during his restructuring of the army. They were the "King's Army" rather than the army of the kingdom, owing allegiance only to the royal house. Each province was required to provide a single "taxis," or regiment, made up of highly-trained commoners. Command of these regiments was usually entrusted to nobles originating from the same area as the troops themselves. When he came to the throne, however, Alexander ended this noble-based leadership, and new commanders were drawn from the regiments themselves, promoted strictly on merit rather than on family connections. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the time of his invasion of Persia the hypaspists numbered approximately 3000 men organized into three units. In battle the hypaspists' primary weapon was the "sarissai," an extra-long spear or pike reserved for their use. Carrying a very small shield and wearing the traditional helmets and greaves, individually they were relatively lightly-armored for the age. However, when formed into a phalanx, these soldiers were particularly deadly to the sword-armed troops that Alexander usually faced. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Alexander favored battle tactics that were aimed at forcing a quick decision on the field. The young general employed unexpected maneuvers and sudden charges to break the morale of the enemy and create panic among enemy units not yet engaged; drilled in rapid movement in formation and legendary for their ferocity, the hypaspists were the perfect infantry for Alexander's army.</English>

Ils sont tr&#232;s mobiles pour l'&#233;poque et Alexandre tire parti de cet avantage dans des batailles comme Ch&#233;ron&#233;e en 338 av. J.-C.

Sie waren im Vergleich zu anderen Fu&#223;soldaten dieses Zeitalters &#228;u&#223;erst wendig. Ein Umstand, den Alexander im Gefecht, beispielsweise in der Schlacht von Chaironea im Jahr 338 vor Christus, zu seinem Vorteil nutzte. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Die ersten Hypaspisten wurden im Rahmen der Neustrukturierung seines Heeres von Philipp II. aus den Provinzen des K&#246;nigreichs Makedonien rekrutiert. Sie galten eher als die "Armee des K&#246;nigs" als die Armee des K&#246;nigreichs, denn sie waren ausschlie&#223;lich dem K&#246;nigshaus verantwortlich. Jede Provinz musste eine einzelne "Taxis" (Regiment) stellen, die sich aus gut ausgebildeten B&#252;rgern zusammensetzte. Die Befehlsgewalt &#252;ber diese Regimenter oblag in der Regel Edelleuten, die aus der gleichen Region stammten wie die Truppen selbst. Als Alexander den Thron bestieg, hatte diese F&#252;hrungsstruktur der Adligen jedoch ein Ende: Er ging dazu &#252;ber, die neuen Kommandanten direkt aus den Regimentern zu bestimmen, wobei die Bef&#246;rderung strikt von den Verdiensten der betreffenden Person abhing und weniger von der famili&#228;ren Abstammung. Zum Zeitpunkt der Invasion in das Perserreich z&#228;hlten die Hypaspisten etwa 3.000 M&#228;nner, die in drei Regimenter aufgeteilt waren. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Die Prim&#228;rwaffen der Hypaspisten waren die "Sarissai", besonders lange Speere oder Piken, deren Nutzung ausschlie&#223;lich ihnen vorbehalten war.

Angesichts der Tatsache, dass sie f&#252;r schnelle Formationsvorst&#246;&#223;e ausgebildet waren und &#252;ber legend&#228;re Schlagkraft verf&#252;gten, bildeten die Hypaspisten die perfekte Infanterie f&#252;r Alexanders Streitmacht.</German>

		<Spanish>La terracota (del italiano terra cotta "tierra cocida") es la arcilla modelada y endurecida al horno, fundamento de los trabajos de cer&#225;mica, utilizada tanto para recipientes, como para la realizaci&#243;n de esculturas y decoraci&#243;n arquitect&#243;nica. Incluso en Etruria, durante los siglos III y II a. C., se utiliz&#243; para la elaboraci&#243;n de sarc&#243;fagos. En Merimde fue empleada desde el cuarto milenio a.

La arcilla es una mezcla de minerales con una peque&#241;a cantidad de sustancias org&#225;nicas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Antes de que se inventara el torno, el hombre modelaba la arcilla con sus manos, preparando una pasta que luego apretaba y lavaba para finalmente dejarla decantar en peque&#241;os recipientes.

		<English>Rye is one of a number of species that grow wild in central and eastern Turkey, and adjacent areas. Domesticated rye occurs in small quantities at a number of Neolithic sites in Turkey, such as PPNB Can Hasan III, but is otherwise virtually absent from the archaeological record until the Bronze Age of central Europe, c. 1800-1500 BC. It is possible that rye traveled west from Turkey as a minor admixture in wheat (possibly as a result of Vavilovian mimicry), and was only later cultivated in its own right. Although archeological evidence of this grain has been found in Roman contexts along the Rhine, Danube, and in the British Isles, Pliny the Elder was dismissive of rye, writing that it "is a very poor food and only serves to avert starvation" and spelt is mixed into it "to mitigate its bitter taste, and even then is most unpleasant to the stomach" (N.H. 18.40).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since the Middle Ages, rye has been widelycultivated in Central and Eastern Europe, and is the main bread cereal in most areas east of the French-German border and north of Hungary.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Claims of much earlier cultivation of rye, at the Epipalaeolithic site of Tell Abu Hureyra in the Euphrates valley of northern Syria, remain controversial.

Hinsichtlich der Gr&#246;&#223;e gibt es aber deutliche Unterschiede zwischen den Neuweltkamelen, die ein Gewicht von 35 bis 150 Kilogramm erreichen und den Altweltkamelen, die zwischen 300 und 700 Kilogramm schwer werden.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Namengebend f&#252;r die Unterordnung ("Schwielensohler") ist der Aufbau der F&#252;&#223;e: Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Paarhufern, die mit den hufumkleideten Spitzen der Zehen auftreten, ber&#252;hren die Kamele mit dem vorletzten und letzten Glied der Zehen den Boden. Sie tragen keine Hufschalen, sondern gebogene N&#228;gel, wodurch aber nur die Vorderkante der F&#252;&#223;e gesch&#252;tzt wird. Die Zehen ruhen auf einem elastischen Polster aus Bindegewebe, das eine breite Sohlenfl&#228;che bildet. Die jeweils zwei Zehen sind die Mittelstrahlen (dritter und vierte Zehe), die &#252;brigen Zehen sind v&#246;llig r&#252;ckgebildet. Dar&#252;ber hinaus sind Mittelhand- und Mittelfu&#223;knochen zum so genannten Kanonenbein verwachsen und auch die Unterarmknochen sind teilweise zusammengewachsen. Im Gegensatz zu den &#252;brigen Paarhufern bewegen sich Kamele im Passgang fort, das hei&#223;t es wird immer abwechselnd das linke und rechte Beinpaar bewegt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Der Sch&#228;del der Kamele ist flach und langgestreckt, H&#246;rner oder ein Geweih sind nicht vorhanden. Die Oberlippe ist gespalten, die N&#252;stern sind verschlie&#223;bar. Diese Tiere haben 30 bis 34 Z&#228;hne: pro Kieferh&#228;lfte ist nur ein oberer Schneidezahn vorhanden, der eckzahn&#228;hnlich entwickelt ist, die insgesamt sechs spachtelf&#246;rmigen unteren Schneidez&#228;hne ragen nach vorne. Zwischen dem Eckzahn und den Backenz&#228;hnen klafft eine als Diastema bezeichnete L&#252;cke.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Da Kamele vorwiegend trockene Regionen bewohnen, haben sie eine Reihe von Merkmalen entwickelt, mit dem Wasser besser hauszuhalten. Stark verl&#228;ngerte Henlesche Schleifen in den Nieren sorgen f&#252;r eine hohe Konzentration des Urins, auch der Kot ist im Vergleich zu anderen S&#228;ugetieren verdickt. Eine Besonderheit sind die Roten Blutk&#246;rperchen, die nicht rund, sondern oval sind. Diese Form bewirkt, dass Kamele in k&#252;rzester Zeit sehr viel Wasser aufnehmen k&#246;nnen (kolportiert werden 200 Liter in 15 Minuten).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kamele sind bereits seit dem dritten vorchristlichen Jahrtausend domestiziert worden.

		<Italian>Camels are in general tall animals who are characterised by a long, thin neck, a small head and relatively long-stretched, slender legs. However, concerning the size there are clear differences between the new world camels who reach a weight from 35 to 150 kilogrammes and the old world camels who reach a weight between 300 and 700 kilogrammes. Camels were firstly domesticated in the third prechristian millennium. They were used with priority as beasts of burden. The military use of camels dates back to the 9-th century before Christ.</Italian>
		<Spanish>El nombre "camello" proviene del hebreo gamal, que significa "devolver" o "compensar", ya que el camello hace generalmente lo que su amo le solicita. Posiblemente relacionado con el t&#233;rmino &#225;rabe jamala.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se utiliza ampliamente para describir a 6 miembros de la familia camelidae: los dos camellos verdaderos, y los cuatro cam&#233;lidos sudamericanos: la llama, la alpaca, el guanaco y la vicu&#241;a.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Existen dos especies de camellos: el bactriano (Camelus bactrianus), provisto de dos jorobas, y el dromedario (Camelus dromedarius), que posee una sola joroba. Ambas especies son rumiantes sin cuernos, sin hocico, con los orificios nasales formando aberturas oblicuas, el labio superior dividido y movible por separado y extensible, sin pezu&#241;as (tienen dos dedos diferenciados), el abdomen elevado y patas largas y delgadas. Al contrario de la creencia popular, el camello almacena grasa en vez de agua en la joroba, que suele caer hacia un costado al encontrarse sin reservas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Se han hecho intentos de utilizar los camellos como caballer&#237;a y monturas de drag&#243;n y como animales de carga en lugar de caballos o mulas. Los camellos han sido usados militarmente, sobre todo, por su habilidad para asustar caballos en registros cerrados, una cualidad famosamente usada por los aquem&#233;nidos persas cuando luchaban contra Lidia. Adem&#225;s, los persas sol&#237;an usar los camellos como trenes de avituallamiento para transportar armas y equipo. Los caballos aborrecen el olor de los camellos que est&#225;n cerca, incluso haci&#233;ndose dif&#237;ciles de controlar.</Spanish>

		<Italian>Papyrus was used for writing. the scrolls were made from the stem of the Papyrus plant. The outer rind is first stripped off, and the sticky fibrous inner pith is cut lengthwise into thin strips of about 40 cm (16 in) long. The strips are then placed side by side on a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping, and then another layer of strips is laid on top at a right angle. The natural glue mashes the layers into a sheet. The Egyptians used Papyrus as early as in the third millennium BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the first century, parchment started to tale the place of Papyrus. In the fourth century Papyrus scrolls were copied to parchment, which was responsible for a selection of what was passed on to future generations.</Italian>
		<Spanish>La palabra papiro proviene del t&#233;rmino griego papiros, que en lat&#237;n es papyrus (el plural es papyri). Est&#225; tomada del antiguo t&#233;rmino egipcio per-pera&#226;, que significa flor del rey, pues su elaboraci&#243;n era monopolio real. Tambi&#233;n es el origen de la palabra papel. Es el nombre que recibe el soporte de escritura elaborado a partir de una planta acu&#225;tica, muy com&#250;n en el r&#237;o Nilo, en Egipto, y en algunos lugares de la cuenca mediterr&#225;nea, una hierba palustre de la familia de las ciper&#225;ceas, el Cyperus papyrus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fue profusamente empleado para la fabricaci&#243;n de diversos objetos de uso cotidiano, siendo su principal utilizaci&#243;n la elaboraci&#243;n del soporte de los manuscritos de la antig&#252;edad denominado papiro, precedente del moderno papel.

Su uso decay&#243; al declinar la antigua cultura egipcia, siendo sustituido como soporte de escritura por el pergamino. Disminuy&#243; en el transcurso del siglo V d.c. y desapareci&#243; del todo en el siglo XI. La mayor&#237;a de las grandes bibliotecas de Europa poseen manuscritos en papiro.</Spanish>

The olive is a bitter fruit but can be eaten (usually after some kind of fermentation or curing) or used to make olive oil. It is not known exactly when olive trees first began being cultivated by humans, but they have been in use since at least 3000 BC. The olive is native to Greece and Palestine, but was later spread to the western Mediterranean and (eventually) all over the world, as it is grown today in California and Australia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Olives and olive oil both possessed special religious significance for the ancient Greeks. According to legend, the olive tree was created by the goddess Athena and used to win a contest with the god Poseidon over who would name a newly founded city; as a result of her gift of the olive, the city of Athens bears her name to this day. The ancient Greeks considered the olive to be sacred; it was a symbol of peace, wisdom, and triumph. Olive wreaths were used to crown Olympic champions. Olive oil was used in Hellenic religious ceremonies, and to this day it continues to possess a special importance in the Greek Orthodox Church.

C.), el tercer fara&#243;n de la Dinast&#237;a I. M&#225;s adelante, el fara&#243;n Seneferu, de la Dinast&#237;a IV, predecesor de los faraones que construyeron las pir&#225;mides de Guiza, orden&#243; inscribir que invadi&#243; Nubia y trajo a 100.000 cautivos y m&#225;s de 200.000 cabezas de ganado. Este hecho refleja la codicia de Seneferu, pero tambi&#233;n es indicio de la pr&#243;spera poblaci&#243;n Nubia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Uno de los templos m&#225;s importantes fue erigido por la reina Hatshepsut (1490-1468 a. C.), en Buhen y dedicado a Horus, el dios halc&#243;n; otros en Semna oeste y en Dibeira. En Semna este (Kumma) ella dedic&#243; su templo al dios Jnum y fue ampliado por su sucesor, Tutmosis III. Tambi&#233;n dedic&#243; un templo Tutmosis III, en Semna oeste, a los dioses locales, a Dedwan, el dios del incienso, y dios de Nubia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Faraones del Imperio Nuevo, como Rams&#233;s II (1290-1224 a. C.), se elevaron a la realeza porque pudieron imponerse a los nubios, arrastrarlos a la derrota y la humillaci&#243;n. Los nubios y jud&#237;os construyeron los palacios de Rams&#233;s, m&#250;ltiples mansiones y templos. Para mostrar su divinidad &#233;l no encontr&#243; nada mejor que construir su maravilloso templo en Abu Simbel. Rams&#233;s II construy&#243; en el centro de Nubia el templo de Aksha, y el Virrey Stau y su esposa fueron representados, ador&#225;ndolo, en el templo de Faras.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Durante el Tercer periodo intermedio de Egipto (-1085 / -750), Nubia recuper&#243; su independencia. Se constituy&#243; entonces un reino kushita que iba a perdurar durante unos mil a&#241;os. En el siglo VIII a. C., los nubios Shabako, Taharqo y Pianjy vengaron a sus antepasados y condujeron sus carros de guerra hasta Kemet (Egipto), para tomar en Menfis la Corona Doble del Alto y Bajo Egipto, fundando la dinast&#237;a XXV de Egipto. Permanecieron en el trono 67 a&#241;os y sus monumentos todav&#237;a se pueden contemplar. Hacia -660, los faraones kushitas fueron expulsados a su regi&#243;n de origen, Nubia, y formaron en Napata un reino original, s&#237;ntesis de las influencias nubias y egipcias; el reino de Kush adopt&#243; muchas pr&#225;cticas egipcias, como su religi&#243;n y las pir&#225;mides.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hacia 591 a. C., a consecuencia de la expedici&#243;n de Psam&#233;tico II contra Kush, la capital se traslad&#243; de Napata a Meroe. A esto, se a&#241;adi&#243; el endurecimiento de las condiciones clim&#225;ticas, lo que relegaba el norte a funciones secundarias.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A partir de 315 a 295 a. C., se acentu&#243; la ruptura (nunca terminada) con el modelo egipcio. Bajo Nastasen (335 a 315 a. C.), Meroe arrebat&#243; a Napata las &#250;ltimas grandes funciones que le quedaban, las de lugar de coronaci&#243;n e inhumaci&#243;n de los soberanos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tras las campa&#241;as de Alejandro Magno el territorio actualmente llamado Nubia fue denominado "&#198;tiop&#237;a" o, m&#225;s precisamente: Baja Etiop&#237;a (que no debe confundirse con el actual Estado llamado Etiop&#237;a). En aquella &#233;poca tuvo lugar el advenimiento de las "Candaces", reinas que ejerc&#237;an el poder pol&#237;tico supremo. Se encuentra un eco de ello en la Biblia (Hechos de los Ap&#243;stoles).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la &#233;poca romana, los kushitas comerciaban con los romanos y eran tambi&#233;n mercenarios. Durante ese tiempo, las diferentes regiones se dividieron y combatieron por el control de Nubia, dejando a la regi&#243;n vulnerable a los ataques, de lo que se aprovecharon los Noba para conquistar Nubia. Es posible que la palabra Nubia provenga de los Noba, o de la palabra egipcia Nub: oro. Los romanos de entonces les llamaban Nobatae.</Spanish>

A su vez, la Transalpina era dividida en cuatro que, seg&#250;n la &#233;poca de Roma, llamaron Galia B&#233;lgica (de celtas menos ortodoxos), la Galia Comata o Melenuna (la netamente celta o tradicional), la Galia Aquitana (con celtas de caracter&#237;sticas diversas o poco definidas) y la Galia Luguria o Celtoligur, la primera en ser anexada a Roma como la Provintia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Julio C&#233;sar se dirigi&#243; hacia las tribus celtas de las Galias entre el 58 y el 51 a.C y escribi&#243; sus experiencias en De Bello Gallico ('sobre la guerra de las Galias'). La regi&#243;n que entonces conquistar&#237;a C&#233;sar era la Galia Transalpina, donde se hallaba incluida la Gallia Comata o Melenuna (Galia Cabelluda).

Como la paz duraba poco en esos territorios, las continuas disputas entre las dos grandes confederaciones de heduos y arvernos, y la amistad con que Roma hab&#237;a distinguido a los primeros, es por lo que Julio C&#233;sar ve la excusa perfecta para instalarse en el lugar. Siempre con el pretexto de pacificar la regi&#243;n, lleva a cabo diversas acciones en contra de varias tribus galas, y en 56 a.C libr&#243; una batalla naval contra los v&#233;netos en su paso hacia Britania (Gran Breta&#241;a).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el a&#241;o 55 a.C, pueblos celtas a los que Julio C&#233;sar confunde con germanos, se hallaban muy cerca de las Galias, en la otra orilla del Rin.

		<Italian>[H1]The Huns[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]The Huns were a group of nomadic pastoral people who, appearing from beyond the Volga, migrated into Europe c. AD 370 and built up an enormous empire in Europe. The Huns may have stimulated the Great Migration, a contributing factor in the collapse of the western Roman Empire. They formed a unified empire under Attila the Hun, who died in 453; their empire broke up the next year. Their descendants, or successors with similar names, are recorded by neighbouring populations to the south, east, and west as having occupied parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia roughly from the 4th century to the 6th century. Variants of the Hun name are recorded in the Caucasus until the early 8th century.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Los hunos[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Los hunos fueron una confederaci&#243;n de tribus euroasi&#225;ticas, muchas de ellas de los m&#225;s diversos or&#237;genes, unidas por una aristocracia que hablaba una lengua t&#250;rquica. Este grupo humano apareci&#243; en Europa en el siglo IV, y su m&#225;ximo exponente fue Atila el Huno. Los hunos fueron llamados b&#225;rbaros por los romanos, a los que invadieron entre los siglos IV y V.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Excelentes jinetes arqueros, veloces y decididos, de t&#225;ctica impredecible, extendieron el miedo por el Imperio. Pactaron con Roma en contra de los germanos de la Europa Central y, hacia el 432 ten&#237;an un caudillo principal, Rua o Rugila, a cuya muerte (434) le sucedieron sus sobrinos Bleda y Atila. Eran n&#243;madas y viv&#237;an en chozas temporales, aunque conoc&#237;an la propiedad de la tierra y sol&#237;an serpentear por zonas concretas que estuvieran en su poder. Por su condici&#243;n n&#243;mada, la vaca y la cacer&#237;a ten&#237;an un papel m&#225;s importante en su econom&#237;a que la agricultura. Las carencias en su dieta eran saciadas por medio del comercio y, de forma mucho m&#225;s habitual, el pillaje en territorio extranjero. Las armas que empleaban en la guerra eran la espada recta, la lanza, el lazo (especie de cuerda con la que lazaban a sus enemigos y les romp&#237;an el cuello) y el arco, que sol&#237;an utilizar desde el caballo. A esto contribu&#237;a el uso del estribo, que tomaron de los chinos y que introdujeron m&#225;s tarde en Persia y Europa.</Spanish>

Ateas died in battle, and his empire disintegrated. In the aftermath of this defeat, the Celts seem to have displaced the Scythians from the Balkans, while in south Russia a kindred tribe, the Sarmatians, gradually overwhelmed them. In 329 BC Philip's son, Alexander the Great, came into conflict with the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes. A nomad army sought to take revenge for the death of Ateas against the Macedonians, as they pushed the borders of their empire north and east, and take advantage of a revolt by the local Sogdian satrap. However, the nomad army was utterly crushed by Alexander, and following this defeat, the Scythians were no longer in a position to challenge the power of Macedon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the time of Strabo's account (the first decades of the first millennium AD), the Crimean Scythians had created a new kingdom extending from the lower Dnieper to the Crimea. The kings Skilurus and Palakus waged wars with Mithridates the Great (reigned 12063 BC) for control of the Crimean littoral, including Chersonesos and the Cimmerian Bosporus.

		<German>[H1]Die Skythen[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Als Skythen werden einige der fr&#252;hesten Reiternomadenv&#246;lker bezeichnet, die im 1. Jahrtausend v. Chr. in dem eurasischen Steppeng&#252;rtel n&#246;rdlich des Schwarzen Meeres lebten und in Gebieten des heutigen S&#252;drussland und der Ukraine bis zum Dnepr ans&#228;ssig waren. Sie hinterlie&#223;en keinerlei schriftliche Aufzeichnungen, und alles, was man &#252;ber sie wei&#223;, beruht auf Bodenfunden und antiken Quellen. Nach dem antiken griechischen Geschichtsschreiber Herodot nannte sich der herrschende Klan Skoloten; die Bezeichnung Skythen stammt aus griechischen Quellen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Im 8. Jahrhundert v. Chr. fielen die Skythen in die Gebiete n&#246;rdlich und &#246;stlich des Schwarzen Meeres ein und verdr&#228;ngten die Kimmerer. Zwischen 630 und 625 v. Chr. unternahmen die Skythen einen Vorsto&#223; nach Vorderasien, und Raubz&#252;ge bis nach Pal&#228;stina. Sie wurden zwar durch Psammetich I. (670626) zur&#252;ckgeschlagen und gegen L&#246;segeld zum Abzug bewogen, pl&#252;nderten und zerst&#246;rten aber auf dem R&#252;ckweg Askalon. Der Fall von Urartu im letzten Drittel des 7. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. wird jedenfalls vor allem auf die Skythen zur&#252;ckgef&#252;hrt. Diese Feldz&#252;ge wurden vermutlich aus dem Kuban-Gebiet und dem n&#246;rdlichen Kaukasus unternommen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]612 v. Chr. eroberten die Meder zusammen mit den Babyloniern und den Skythen Niniveh. Nach der Babylonischen Chronik eroberten die Skythen 609 &#196;gypten. Mit dem Beginn der Mederherrschaft (612 und 605 v. Chr.) ging der skythische Einfluss im vorderen Orient zur&#252;ck. Herodot berichtet allerdings, die Skythen h&#228;tten 28 Jahre lang ganz Asien regiert, von dem Sieg des Madyes &#252;ber den Medier Praortes bis zur Niederlage gegen die Medier unter Kyaxares II. (624585) im Jahr 594 v. Chr., der bei einem Gastmahl ihre Abgesandten umbringen konnte. Zu dieser Zeit war Madyas, Sohn des Protothyas F&#252;hrer der Skythen. Danach zogen sich die Skythen nach Norden zur&#252;ck. Manche Forscher setzen die verst&#228;rkte Besiedlung des n&#246;rdlichen Schwarzmeerraumes erst in diese Zeit. 515/514 v. Chr. unternahm der Perserk&#246;nig Darius I. der Gro&#223;e mit einer mehrere hunderttausend Mann starken Armee einen erfolglosen Feldzug gegen die Skythen, deren Ostgrenze zu dieser Zeit am Don lag.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Einer der bekanntesten K&#246;nige der Skythen war Atheas, der im Westen bis an die Donau vordrang und 339 v. Chr. hochbetagt gegen Philipp II. von Makedonien zu Felde zog und fiel. 331 f&#252;hrten die Makedonen unter Zopyrion einen weiteren Krieg gegen die Skythen. Sie stie&#223;en bis Olbia vor, konnten die Stadt aber nicht einnehmen und wurden auf dem R&#252;ckzug vernichtend geschlagen. In der Folge siedelten sich die Skythen auf der Dobrudscha an. Alexander begann 330 Freundschaftsverhandlungen mit den Skythen, plante aber Arrian (Anabasis, 4,1) zufolge einen Feldzug zur Eroberung des n&#246;rdlichen Schwarzmeergebietes und die Gr&#252;ndung einer Stadt am Tanais. Die Skythen boten ihm eine Heirat mit einer skythischen Prinzessin an, was er jedoch ablehnte. 329 kam es zu einem Zusammensto&#223; mit den Massageten in Baktrien, bei dem die makedonischen Truppen unter Krateros jedoch siegreich blieben. 323 wird eine weitere skythische Delegation in Babylon erw&#228;hnt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ab dem 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurden die Skythen zunehmend von den Sarmaten verdr&#228;ngt. Auch Klimaver&#228;nderungen werden jedoch f&#252;r den Niedergang der Skythen verantwortlich gemacht.</German>

		<German>[H1]Die Berber[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Viele Jahrhunderte lang bewohnten die Berber die K&#252;ste Nordafrikas von &#196;gypten bis zum Atlantischen Ozean. W&#228;hrenddessen blickten die K&#252;stenregionen Nordafrikas auf eine lange Reihe von Eroberern, Siedlern und Kolonisatoren einschlie&#223;lich der Ph&#246;nizier, die Karthago gr&#252;ndeten, Griechen (haupts&#228;chlich in Kyrene), R&#246;mer, Vandalen, Alanen, Byzantiner, Araber, Osmanen, Franzosen und Spanier. Die meisten, wenn nicht sogar alle dieser Eindringlinge pr&#228;gten die heutigen Berber. Ebenso brachten die osmanischen Korsaren Sklaven von S&#252;deuropa in den Barbareskenstaat. Eine Sch&#228;tzung legt die Zahl der Europ&#228;er, welche w&#228;hrend der Osmanenherrschaft nach Nordafrika verschleppt wurden, bei 1,25 Millionen an. Beeinflussungen des Sudanreichs, Schwarzafrikas und Nomaden aus Ostafrika pr&#228;gten die Berber ebenfalls enorm.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Die Gegenden Nordafrikas, welche die Berbersprachen und die Traditionen der Berber bewahrt haben, im besonderen das Hochland der Kabylei im heutigen Algerien und die Volksst&#228;mme der Chleuh und Rifkabylen -, sind im Allgemeinen am wenigsten fremder Herrschaft ausgesetzt gewesen. Sogar in r&#246;mischer und osmanischer Zeit blieben die meisten von ihnen separat und unabh&#228;ngig. Sogar die Ph&#246;nizier drangen niemals hinter die Hafenst&#228;dte der K&#252;ste vor. W&#228;hrend viele Leute Verbindungen mit den Einheimischen herstellten und Waren und Dienste austauschten, war eine vollst&#228;ndige Verbindung nur mit den R&#246;mern gegeben, wodurch numidische und mauretanische Provinzen vollst&#228;ndig in das R&#246;mische Reich eingegliedert wurden und die Berber das r&#246;mische B&#252;rgerrecht erhielten. Unter den Leuten, die mit den Einheimischen siedelten, waren 80.000 Familien der germanischen Vandalen, die von den R&#246;mern und den Mittelmeerbewohnern im Allgemeinen auch als Barbaren bezeichnet wurden. Die germanischen Familien kamen weder um noch kehrten sie nach Germanien zur&#252;ck, sondern vermischten sich mit der einheimischen Bev&#246;lkerung. Letztendlich wurden die Germanen durch r&#246;mische Streitkr&#228;fte aus Nordafrika vertrieben.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Berber sind vor allem im heutigen Marokko und Algerien anzutreffen, vereinzelte Gruppen auch in Tunesien und s&#252;dlich davon in der Sahara. Ihre heutigen Bev&#246;lkerungszahlen sind schwer zu bestimmen, da durch die Vermischung mit der arabischen Bev&#246;lkerung und die Arabisierungsma&#223;namen der postkolonialen Zeit Kultur und Sprache der Berber zur&#252;ckgedr&#228;ngt wurden.

		<English>[H1]Iberia[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]The Iberians were a set of peoples that Greek and Roman sources (among others, Hecataeus of Miletus, Avienus, Herodotus and Strabo) identified with that name in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian peninsula at least from the 6th century BC. These included the Airenosi, Andosini, Ausetani, Bastetani, Bastuli, Bergistani, Castellani, Cessetani, Ceretani, Contestani, Edetani, Elisices, Iacetani, Ilercavones, Ilergetes, Indigetes, Lacetani, Laietani, Oretani, Sedetani, Sordones, Suessetani, and Turdetani (there are some doubts regarding the ethno-linguistic affiliation of some of these). The Roman and Greek sources often diverge about the precise location of each Iberian people and also about the list of Iberian peoples.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The term Iberian as used by the ancient authors had two meanings. One, more general, referred to the whole of the population of the Iberian peninsula.

They also had a knowledge of metalworking, including bronze, and agricultural techniques. In the centuries preceding Carthaginian and Roman conquest, Iberian settlements grew in social complexity, exhibiting evidence of social stratification and urbanization. This process was probably aided by trading contacts with the Phoenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. Among the most important goods traded by the Iberians were precious metals, particularly tin and copper.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Phoenicians established their first colony on the Iberian Peninsula in 1100 B.C. (Gadir, Gades, modern Cdiz) and probably made contact with Iberians then or shortly thereafter.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Greek colonists made the first historical reference to the Iberians in the 6th century B.C. The Greeks also dubbed as "Iberians" another people, currently known as Caucasian Iberians.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Iberians were placed under Carthaginian rule for a short time between the First and Second Punic Wars. They supplied troops to Hannibal's army. The Romans subsequently conquered the Iberian Peninsula and slowly supplanted the local culture with their own.</English>

		<German>[H1]Iberien[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Die Iberer waren eine Volks- oder Stammesgruppe, welche bereits in pr&#228;historischer Zeit die Iberische Halbinsel, zeitweise auch Gebiete au&#223;erhalb derselben, bewohnten.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Der r&#246;mische Geschichtsschreiber Marcus Terentius Varro (Plinius der &#196;ltere Nat. Hist. III, I, 8) berichtet, Spanien sei nacheinander von den Iberern, Persern, Ph&#246;niziern, Kelten und Karthagern besiedelt worden.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Die Ph&#246;nizier errichteten ihre erste Kolonie auf der iberischen Halbinsel Gadir, Gades, modern Cdiz im 8. Jahrhundert v. Chr. und nahmen mit den Iberern wahrscheinlich zu diesem Zeitpunkt oder wenig sp&#228;ter Verbindung auf. Die Iberer traten erstmals im 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. in Erscheinung. Sie lebten zun&#228;chst in geschlossenen Gemeinschaften, die aus St&#228;mmen aufgebaut waren. Sie hatten Kenntnisse und Fertigkeiten in der Metallverarbeitung, einschlie&#223;lich der Verarbeitung von Bronze und des Ackerbaus. In sp&#228;teren Jahren entwickelten die Iberer eine vielschichtigere Kultur mit verst&#228;dterten Siedlungen und gesellschaftlichen Schichtung. Die Iberer hatten seit 800 v. Chr. mit den Ph&#246;niziern und Griechen Handelskontakte, bei denen das auf der Iberischen Halbinsel vorkommende Silber ein begehrtes Produkt war. Diese bis ins 5. vorchristliche Jahrhundert reichende Periode des Handels stellt gleichzeitig die Bl&#252;tezeit der iberischen Kultur dar. Aus den vorwiegend s&#252;dspanischen Kerngebieten breiteten sich die Iberer nach Nordosten, bis in das heutige S&#252;dfrankreich hin aus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Zur Zeit der Punischen Kriege gerieten die Iberer ins Blickfeld der &#252;berlieferten Geschichte. Zwischen dem ersten und dem zweiten punischen Krieg kamen sie f&#252;r kurze Zeit unter die Herrschaft der Karthager. Beide Volksgruppen stellten auch Truppen f&#252;r Hannibals Heer. Anschlie&#223;end wurden sie vom r&#246;mischen Reich milit&#228;risch bedr&#228;ngt und letztendlich besetzt. Die folgende Romanisierung bedeutete das Ende einer eigenst&#228;ndigen Kultur oder Politik.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Iberia[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]The Iberians were a set of peoples that Greek and Roman sources (among others, Hecataeus of Miletus, Avienus, Herodotus and Strabo) identified with that name in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian peninsula at least from the 6th century BC. These included the Airenosi, Andosini, Ausetani, Bastetani, Bastuli, Bergistani, Castellani, Cessetani, Ceretani, Contestani, Edetani, Elisices, Iacetani, Ilercavones, Ilergetes, Indigetes, Lacetani, Laietani, Oretani, Sedetani, Sordones, Suessetani, and Turdetani (there are some doubts regarding the ethno-linguistic affiliation of some of these). The Roman and Greek sources often diverge about the precise location of each Iberian people and also about the list of Iberian peoples.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The term Iberian as used by the ancient authors had two meanings. One, more general, referred to the whole of the population of the Iberian peninsula. The other, more restricted, with an ethnic sense, to the people living in the eastern and southern coasts of the Iberian peninsula, where by the sixth century BC they had absorbed cultural influences from Phoenicians and Greeks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Iberians lived in isolated communities based on a tribal organization.

		<Spanish>[H1]Iberia[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Los iberos o &#237;beros fue como llamaron los antiguos escritores griegos a las gentes del levante y sur de la pen&#237;nsula ib&#233;rica para distinguirlos de los pueblos del interior, cuya cultura y costumbres eran diferentes. De estos pueblos escribieron Hecateo de Mileto, Her&#243;doto, Estrab&#243;n o Rufo Festo Avieno, cit&#225;ndolos con estos nombres, al menos desde el siglo VI a. C.: elisices, sordones, ceretanos, airenosinos, andosinos, bergistanos, ausetanos, indigetes, castelani, lacetanos, layetanos, cossetanos, ilergetas, iacetanos, suessetanos, sedetanos, ilercavones, edetanos, contestanos, oretanos, bastetanos y turdetanos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Geogr&#225;ficamente, Estrab&#243;n y Apiano denominaron Iberia al territorio de la pen&#237;nsula ib&#233;rica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Historia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aunque las fuentes cl&#225;sicas no siempre coinciden en los l&#237;mites geogr&#225;ficos precisos ni en la enumeraci&#243;n de pueblos concretos, parece que la lengua es el criterio fundamental que los identificaba como iberos desde el punto de vista de griegos y romanos, puesto que las inscripciones en lengua ib&#233;rica aparecen a grandes rasgos en el territorio que las fuentes cl&#225;sicas asignan a los iberos: la zona costera que va desde el sur del Languedoc-Rosell&#243;n hasta Alicante, que penetra hacia el interior por el valle del Ebro, por el valle del Segura, gran parte de La Mancha meridional y oriental hasta el r&#237;o Guadiana y por el valle alto del Guadalquivir.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Desde el punto de vista arqueol&#243;gico actual, el concepto de cultura ib&#233;rica no es un patr&#243;n que se repite de forma uniforme en cada uno de los pueblos identificados como iberos, sino la suma de las culturas individuales que a menudo presentan rasgos similares, pero que se diferencian claramente en otros y que a veces comparten con pueblos no identificados como iberos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Referencias hist&#243;ricas[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La primera referencia que se tiene de los iberos es a trav&#233;s de los historiadores y ge&#243;grafos griegos. Curiosamente, los griegos tambi&#233;n llamaban iberos a un pueblo de la actual Georgia, conocido como Iberia cauc&#225;sica, con los que, sin duda, no tienen ning&#250;n parentesco. Al principio, los griegos utilizaron la palabra ibero para designar el litoral mediterr&#225;neo occidental, y posteriormente, para designar a todas las tribus de la pen&#237;nsula. Tambi&#233;n llamaban Iberia al conjunto de sus pueblos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Las primeras descripciones de la costa ibera mediterr&#225;nea provienen de Avieno en su Ora maritima, del viaje de un marino de Massalia mil a&#241;os antes (530 a. C.):[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  "La mayor parte de los autores refieren que los iberos se llaman as&#237; justo por este r&#237;o, pero no por aquel r&#237;o que ba&#241;a a los revoltosos vascones. Pues a toda la zona de este pueblo que se encuentra junto a tal r&#237;o, en direcci&#243;n occidente, se la denomina Iberia. Sin embargo el &#225;rea oriental abarca a tartesios y cilbicenos."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Apiano habla de pueblos y ciudades, aunque ya hab&#237;an desaparecido en su &#233;poca. Tambi&#233;n describe la parte m&#225;s occidental de Andaluc&#237;a. Estrab&#243;n hace una descripci&#243;n de esta zona bas&#225;ndose en autores anteriores, y se refiere a las ciudades de la Turdetania, como descendientes de la cultura de Tartessos. En general, autores como Plinio el Viejo y otros historiadores latinos se limitan a hablar de pasada sobre estos pueblos como antecedentes de la Hispania romana.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Para estudiar a los iberos, se ha recurrido, adem&#225;s de a las fuentes literarias, a las fuentes epigr&#225;ficas, numism&#225;ticas, y arqueol&#243;gicas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Origen de los iberos[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A pesar de que estos pueblos compart&#237;an ciertas caracter&#237;sticas comunes, no eran un grupo &#233;tnico homog&#233;neo ya que diverg&#237;an en muchos aspectos. No se sabe detalladamente el origen de los iberos, aunque hay varias teor&#237;as que intentan establecerlos:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  Una hip&#243;tesis sugiere que llegaron a la pen&#237;nsula ib&#233;rica en el periodo Neol&#237;tico, y su llegada se data desde el quinto milenio antes de Cristo al tercer milenio antes de Cristo. La mayor&#237;a de los estudiosos que adoptan esta teor&#237;a se apoyan en evidencias arqueol&#243;gicas, antropol&#243;gicas y gen&#233;ticas estimando que los iberos proced&#237;an de las regiones mediterr&#225;neas situadas m&#225;s al este.[NEWLINE]  Otros estudiosos han sugerido que pueden tener su origen en el norte de &#193;frica pero se corrobor&#243; que esta teor&#237;a era err&#243;nea. Los iberos inicialmente se habr&#237;an asentado a lo largo de la costa oriental de Espa&#241;a y, posiblemente, m&#225;s adelante se propagaron por parte de la pen&#237;nsula ib&#233;rica.[NEWLINE]  Otra hip&#243;tesis alternativa afirma que formaban parte de los habitantes originales de Europa occidental y los creadores/herederos de la gran cultura megal&#237;tica que surge en toda esta zona, posiblemente, una teor&#237;a respaldada por estudios gen&#233;ticos. Los iberos ser&#237;an similares a las poblaciones celtas del primer milenio antes de Cristo de Irlanda, Gran Breta&#241;a y Francia. Posteriormente, los celtas cruzar&#237;an los Pirineos en dos grandes migraciones: en el IX y el VII siglo a. C. Los celtas se establecieron en su mayor parte al norte del r&#237;o Duero y el r&#237;o Ebro, donde se mezclaron con los iberos para conformar el grupo llamado celt&#237;bero.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Origen y extensi&#243;n de los proto&#237;beros[\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los supuestos l&#237;mites m&#225;ximos de la expansi&#243;n &#237;bera habr&#237;an llegado desde el mediod&#237;a franc&#233;s hasta el Algarve portugu&#233;s y el norte de la costa africana.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sin embargo, con posterioridad, los pueblos celt&#237;beros ejercieron influencia sobre otros pueblos del interior de la pen&#237;nsula. Esta influencia se aprecia en la llegada del torno de alfarero a muchas zonas de la meseta norte de la pen&#237;nsula, sobre todo a los pueblos lim&#237;trofes del valle del Ebro, e incluso a algunos m&#225;s alejados como ar&#233;vacos, pelendones o vacceos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los iberos ser&#237;an, en definitiva, los diferentes pueblos que evolucionan desde diferentes culturas precedentes hacia una serie de estructuras proto-estatales, vi&#233;ndose ayudados en dicha evoluci&#243;n por la influencia de fenicios, primero, y luego de griegos y p&#250;nicos, que traer&#225;n consigo elementos de lujo que ayudar&#225;n, como bienes de prestigio, a la diferenciaci&#243;n interna de los diversos grupos sociales.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]Phoenicia[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Phoenicia was an ancient civilization centered in the north of ancient Canaan, with its heartland along the coastal regions of modern day Lebanon, Syria, and Israel. Phoenician civilization was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the Mediterranean during the period 1550 BC to 300 BC. Though ancient boundaries of such city-centered cultures fluctuated, the city of Tyre seems to have been the southernmost. Sarepta (modern day Sarafand) between Sidon and Tyre is the most thoroughly excavated city of the Phoenician homeland. The Phoenicians often traded by means of a galley, a man-powered sailing vessel, and are credited with the invention of the bireme.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It is uncertain to what extent the Phoenicians viewed themselves as a single ethnicity. Their civilization was organized in city-states, similar to ancient Greece. Each city-state was an independent unit politically, and they could come into conflict and one city could be dominated by another city-state, although they would collaborate in leagues or alliances.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The high point of Phoenician culture and seapower is usually placed ca. 1200-800 BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cyrus the Great conquered Phoenicia in 539 BC. The Persians divided Phoenicia into four vassal kingdoms: Sidon, Tyre, Arwad, and Byblos. They prospered, furnishing fleets for the Persian kings. Phoenician influence declined after this. It is likely that much of the Phoenician population migrated to Carthage and other colonies following the Persian conquest. In 350 or 345 BC a rebellion in Sidon led by Tennes was crushed by Artaxerxes III. Its destruction was described by Diodorus Siculus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Alexander the Great took Tyre in 332 BC following the Siege of Tyre. Alexander was exceptionally harsh to Tyre, executing 2000 of the leading citizens, but he maintained the king in power. He gained control of the other cities peacefully: the ruler of Aradus submitted; the king of Sidon was overthrown. The rise of Hellenistic Greece gradually ousted the remnants of Phoenicia's former dominance over the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes. Phoenician culture disappeared entirely in the motherland. Carthage continued to flourish in North Africa. It oversaw mining iron and precious metals from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests. Rome finally destroyed it in 146 BC, at the end of the Punic Wars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following Alexander, the Phoenician homeland was controlled by a succession of Hellenistic rulers: Laomedon (323 BC), Ptolemy I (320), Antigonus II (315), Demetrius (301), and Seleucus (296). Between 286 and 197 BC, Phoenicia (except for Aradus) fell to the Ptolemies of Egypt, who installed the high priests of Astarte as vassal rulers in Sidon (Eshmunazar I, Tabnit, Eshmunazar II).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 197 BC, Phoenicia along with Syria reverted to the Seleucids. The region became increasingly Hellenized, although Tyre became autonomous in 126 BC, followed by Sidon in 111. Syria, including Phoenicia, were seized by king Tigranes the Great from 82 until 69 BC, when he was defeated by Lucullus. In 65 BC Pompey finally incorporated the territory as part of the Roman province of Syria.</English>

		<Spanish>[H1]Fenicia[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Fenicia (en fenicio kana&#703;an; o P&#363;t) es el nombre de una antigua regi&#243;n de Oriente Pr&#243;ximo, cuna de la civilizaci&#243;n fenicio-p&#250;nica, que se extend&#237;a a lo largo del Levante mediterr&#225;neo, en la costa oriental del mar Mediterr&#225;neo. Su territorio abarcaba desde la desembocadura del r&#237;o Orontes al norte, hasta la bah&#237;a de Haifa al sur, comprendiendo &#225;reas de los actuales Israel, Siria y L&#237;bano, una regi&#243;n denominada antiguamente Cana&#225;n, con cuya denominaci&#243;n se engloba muy a menudo en las fuentes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Poblada desde principios del III milenio a. C. por semitas cananeos, la Fenicia hist&#243;rica se extend&#237;a sobre una estrecha franja costera de 40 km, desde el Monte Carmelo hasta Ugarit (unos 300 km). Su suelo monta&#241;oso y poco apto para la agricultura (aunque se esforzaron por sacarle provecho), orient&#243; a sus habitantes hacia las actividades mar&#237;timas. Con m&#225;s raz&#243;n el mar se le impuso a este pueblo, al quedar dividido en peque&#241;as ciudades estado separadas por espolones rocosos, pues el cabotaje era mejor que las v&#237;as terrestres para el contacto entre las ciudades, que se escalonaban desde Acre y Tiro, por Sid&#243;n y Biblos, hasta Arados y Ugarit. Fenicia, al ser un estrecho paso entre el mar y el desierto de Siria, en contacto al sur, a trav&#233;s de Cana&#225;n y del Sina&#237; con Egipto, y al norte, a trav&#233;s del &#201;ufrates, con Mesopotamia y Asia Menor, estaba destinada a ser una rica encrucijada comercial, codiciada por los grandes imperios vecinos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El nombre &#233;tnico que se daban los fenicios a s&#237; mismos era kena&#703;ani (canaaneos) o bin kena&#703;an (hijos de Cana&#225;n) y coincide con el pueblo cananeo citado en la Biblia. Los griegos los llamaron pho&#237;nikes (rojos, p&#250;rpuras), muy probablemente por los apreciados tintes de color p&#250;rpura con que comerciaban. De pho&#237;niks deriv&#243; el t&#233;rmino fenicio, que se aplica m&#225;s bien a los descendientes de los cananeos que habitaban en la franja costera desde Dor (actual Israel) hasta Arados o Arwad (actual Siria), entre 1200 a. C. y la conquista musulmana. No obstante, el t&#233;rmino pho&#237;niks puede f&#225;cilmente ser una etimolog&#237;a popular derivada del etn&#243;nimo p&#333;n&#299;m, gentilicio de P&#363;t. Este t&#233;rmino denominaba estrictamente la regi&#243;n costera de Cana&#225;n, y muchos de los pueblos fenicios lo utilizaban como sin&#243;nimo. De p&#333;n&#299;m derivar&#237;an tambi&#233;n las formas latinas poenus y punicus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La cultura fenicia es una civilizaci&#243;n antigua que no dej&#243; firmes huellas f&#237;sicas de su existencia. Su lugar geogr&#225;fico en la historia, es la actual Rep&#250;blica Libanesa, y el crecimiento desproporcionado de las ciudades, as&#237; como los frecuentes enfrentamientos b&#233;licos del pasado, han dificultado el hallazgo de restos que revelen su cultura material. Sin embargo, a diferencia de otras, dej&#243; un importante legado cultural a las civilizaciones posteriores, entre ellas crear un importante v&#237;nculo entre las civilizaciones del mar Mediterr&#225;neo, los principios comerciales y el alfabeto.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]Dacia[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]The Dacians (Lat. Daci) were an Indo-European people, the ancient inhabitants of Dacia (located in the area in and around the Carpathian mountains and east of there to the Black Sea), present-day Romania and Moldova, parts of Sarmatia (mostly in eastern Ukraine) and Scythia Minor in southeastern Europe (Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria). They spoke the Dacian language, believed related to Thracian, but were influenced culturally by the neighbouring Scythians and by the Celtic invaders of the 4th century BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Dacians were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and also Getae in Roman documents; also as Dagae and Gaetesee the late Roman map Tabula Peutingeriana. Strabo states that the original name of the Dacians was "daoi", which could be explained with a possible Phrygian cognate "daos", meaning "wolf". This assumption may be supported by the fact that one of the Dacian standards, the Dacian Draco, had a wolf's head. Phrygii was another name used within the region, and in later times, some Roman auxiliaries recruited from the area were referred to as Phrygi. Their capital was not Argedava near the Danube, but Sarmizegetusa, in the Sureanu mountains, in the Romanian Western Carpathians.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first mention of the Dacians is in Roman sources, but classical authors are unanimous in considering them a branch of the Getae, a Thracian people known from Greek writings. Strabo specified that the Daci are the Getae who lived in the area towards the Pannonian plain (Transylvania), while the Getae proper gravitated towards the Black Sea coast (Scythia Minor). The Dacian kingdom reached its maximum extent under king Burebista (ruled 82-44 BC). The capital of the kingdom was the city of Argedava (also called Sargedava in some historical writings) situated close to the river Danube. Greek geographer Strabo claimed that the Dacians and Getae once had been able to muster a combined army of 200,000 men during Strabo's era (i.e. the time of Roman emperor Augustus (sole rule 30 BC-14 AD). Statue of King Decebalus, Deva, Romania, RomaniaThe Roman Emperor Trajan (ruled 97-117 AD) decided to conquer the Dacian kingdom, partly in order to seize its vast gold mines. But it took him two major wars (the Dacian Wars), one in 101-102 AD and the other one in 105-106 AD. In the first war, Trajan invaded Dacia by crossing the river Danube by means of a boat-bridge and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Dacians at the Second Battle of Tapae (101 AD). The Dacian king, Decebalus, was forced to sue for peace. Trajan and Decebalus then concluded a peace which was highly favourable to the Romans. The peace agreement required the Dacians to cede some territory to the Romans and to demolish their fortifications. Decebalus' foreign policy was also restricted, as he was prohibited from entering into alliances with other tribes. Dacian wars depicted on Trajan's columnHowever, both Trajan and Decebalus considered this peace only a temporary truce, and readied themselves for renewed war. Trajan had Greek engineer Apollodorus of Damascus construct a stone bridge over the Danube river, while Decebalus secretly plotted alliances against the Romans. In 105, Trajan crossed the Danube river and besieged Decebalus' capital, Sarmizegetusa but the siege failed because of Decebalus' allied tribes. But Trajan was an optimist. He returned with a newly constituted army and took Sarmizegetusa by assault. Decebalus fled into the mountains hoping to assemble a new army, but he was cornered by pursuing Roman cavalry troopers and committed suicide. The Romans took his head and right hand to Trajan, who had them displayed in the Forum at Rome. Trajan's Column in Rome was constructed to celebrate the conquest of Dacia.</English>

Alternatively, it may refer from this use based on Roman experience of the Germanic tribes as allies of the Celts.</Italian>

		<English>[H1]Macedonia[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Macedonia is a region in the Balkans located north of Greece, east of Illyria, and west of Thrace. Though traditionally regarded by the ancient Greeks as barbarians, under the leadership of several exceptional generals the Macedonians would eventually come to dominate Greece and almost all of the Near East. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Humans have been living in Macedonia since at least 3500 BC. The first recorded king of the region was Caranus, who ruled around 800 BC. In its early years Macedonia was much weaker than the Greek city-states to the south, and the Macedonian kings followed a foreign policy of playing off one Greek city against another, all the while absorbing Greek culture and military knowledge. Over time Caranus's descendents accumulated territory and built up a unified kingdom, growing in strength and cohesion even as the Greeks weakened each other with constant in-fighting. By the fourth century BC, Macedonia was strong enough to challenge her neighbors and she did so, with a vengeance. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]It was under the leadership of Philip II, who ruled from 359-336 BC, that the Macedonians burst onto the stage of history. Philip spent most of his early rule strengthening his army until no one could stand against it, and then he turned south and attacked the rich city-states of Greece. The shocked Greeks at last recognized their peril and united against Macedonian menace, but they were decisively defeated in 338 BC, at the Battle of Chaeronea. Philip established four strongholds across Greece to ensure his dominance of the region; he then turned his attentions east, to Persia, but he was assassinated (in 336 BC) before he could begin the campaign. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Philip was succeeded by his young son, Alexander (ruled 336-323 BC). Upon Philip's death the Greeks revolted, believing that the new ruler of Macedonia was too young and inexperienced to be able to stop them. This of course would turn out to be a massive blunder. Alexander crushed the revolt with ease, razing the ancient city of Thebes to the ground to punish the Greeks for their rebellion. The young warrior-king then invaded Persia attaining and then surpassing his late father's objectives in a spectacular campaign of conquest that raged across the length and breadth of the Near East. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]In a few short years Alexander smashed the Persian army in three crushing battles, usually facing a force far larger than his army, Alexander's astonishing victories can be ascribed to a number of factors, his troops were professionals, very well equipped, highly-trained, and enormously motivated. Further, Alexander himself was an extraordinary strategist and tactician. An extremely charismatic leader, Alexander was also totally fearless, leading his men from the front, always in the thickest of the fight. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]With the Persian army smashed beyond repair, Alexander found himself in control of the entire Persian Empire (not to mention Persia's vassal state, Egypt). Still seeking more glory, Alexander looked further to the east, to the rich lands of India. He had crossed the Indus River and begun to engage the Indian troops, but his campaign was halted, not by an enemy, but by his own exhausted and homesick troops, who begged him to turn back and let them return to their families. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]When he died in 323 BC at the age of 33, Alexander controlled a vast empire stretching from the Balkans to India. Such an expanse of territory was much too great to be controlled by any other single man, and Alexander's empire was divided between his former generals. By 300 BC three major states had formed, controlled by Antigonus (who ruled Greece and Macedonia), Ptolemy (Egypt), and Seleucus (Asia Minor). These successor empires would be ruled by the Macedonian descendents of Alexander's generals for the next centuries. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Eventually, the Romans would conquer Macedonia herself and all of Alexander's territories, and Macedonia would never again play a dominant role among the nations of the world. But her effect upon history cannot be understated: through her conquests Macedonia spread Hellenic culture throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East, influencing the development of that most important region for many years to come.

[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Les premiers hommes sont arriv&#233;s en Mac&#233;doine vers l'an 3500 av. J.-C.. Le premier roi connu de la r&#233;gion est Karanus, dont le r&#232;gne commence vers l'an 800 av. J.-C.. Dans les premi&#232;res ann&#233;es, la Mac&#233;doine est bien moins puissante que les cit&#233;s-&#233;tats grecques du sud, et les rois mac&#233;doniens privil&#233;gient une politique &#233;trang&#232;re qui consiste &#224; monter une cit&#233; grecque contre une autre, tout en tirant profit de la culture et des connaissances militaires de la Gr&#232;ce. Le temps passant, les descendants de Karanus parviennent &#224; accumuler des territoires et &#224; b&#226;tir un royaume uni, fort et solidaire alors que les Grecs concentrent leur &#233;nergie sur des conflits internes. Au IVe si&#232;cle av. J.-C., la Mac&#233;doine est suffisamment puissante pour d&#233;fier ses voisins, ce qu'elle fait par vengeance. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]C'est sous le r&#232;gne de Philippe II, de 359 &#224; 336 av. J.-C., que les Mac&#233;doniens rentrent dans l'Histoire. Philippe consacre les premiers temps de son r&#232;gne &#224; renforcer son arm&#233;e afin qu'elle devienne la plus puissante de toutes, puis d&#233;cide d'attaquer les cit&#233;s-&#233;tats en plein essor au sud de la Gr&#232;ce. Les Grecs, sous le choc, prennent alors conscience du danger et s'unissent pour faire face &#224; la menace mac&#233;donienne. Ils subissent n&#233;anmoins une lourde d&#233;faite en l'an 338 av. J.-C. lors de la bataille de Ch&#233;ron&#233;e. Philippe II fait b&#226;tir quatre forteresses en Gr&#232;ce afin de marquer sa domination sur la r&#233;gion, puis tourne son attention &#224; l'est, vers la Perse. Il est assassin&#233; (en l'an 336 av. J.-C.) avant d'avoir pu commencer sa campagne. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Son jeune fils Alexandre lui succ&#232;de (r&#232;gne de 336 &#224; 323 av. J.-C.). La mort de Philippe entra&#238;ne le soul&#232;vement du peuple grec qui pense que le nouveau souverain de la Mac&#233;doine est bien trop jeune et trop peu exp&#233;riment&#233; pour les arr&#234;ter. Les Grecs ne savent pas encore &#224; qui ils ont affaire. Alexandre met rapidement un terme &#224; la r&#233;volte et le ch&#226;timent est s&#233;v&#232;re. Il d&#233;cide de raser la ville de Th&#232;bes en r&#233;ponse &#224; la r&#233;volte des Grecs. Ce jeune guerrier-roi se met en t&#234;te de conqu&#233;rir la Perse et d&#233;passe les objectifs de son p&#232;re lors d'une campagne spectaculaire visant &#224; envahir tout le Proche-Orient. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]En seulement quelques ann&#233;es, Alexandre &#233;crase l'arm&#233;e perse lors de trois grandes batailles face &#224; des forces militaires souvent plus nombreuses. Les victoires &#233;tonnantes d'Alexandre peuvent &#234;tre attribu&#233;es &#224; plusieurs facteurs : ses troupes sont comp&#233;tentes, tr&#232;s bien &#233;quip&#233;es et incroyablement motiv&#233;es. En outre, Alexandre est un fin strat&#232;ge et tacticien. Ce chef charismatique n'a peur de rien et m&#232;ne ses hommes en t&#234;te, lui-m&#234;me toujours au coeur de l'action. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Une fois l'arm&#233;e perse compl&#232;tement d&#233;mantel&#233;e, Alexandre se retrouve au contr&#244;le de tout l'empire perse (sans oublier l'Egypte, l'&#233;tat vassal de la Perse). Or Alexandre a soif de gloire et tourne son attention plus &#224; l'est, vers les riches terres de l'Inde. Il traverse la rivi&#232;re Indus et d&#233;cide de recruter des troupes indiennes. Sa campagne tourne cependant court, non en raison de ses ennemis, mais du fait de la lassitude et de la nostalgie de ses propres troupes qui le supplient de faire demi-tour et de les laisser rentrer chez elles. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]A sa mort en l'an 323 av. J.-C. &#224; l'&#226;ge de 33 ans, Alexandre est &#224; la t&#234;te d'un gigantesque empire allant des Balkans &#224; l'Inde. Cependant, l'empire d'Alexandre est si vaste que nul autre homme ne peut le diriger seul. Il est alors divis&#233; entre ses anciens g&#233;n&#233;raux. En l'an 300 av. J.-C., trois grands &#233;tats sont ainsi form&#233;s, contr&#244;l&#233;s par Antigone (souverain de la Gr&#232;ce et de la Mac&#233;doine), Ptol&#233;m&#233;e (Egypte) et S&#233;leucos (Asie mineure). Ces trois empires restent sous la domination des descendants mac&#233;doniens des g&#233;n&#233;raux d'Alexandre au cours des si&#232;cles suivants. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]La Mac&#233;doine et tous les territoires d'Alexandre tombent finalement entre les mains des Romains. Depuis, la Mac&#233;doine n'a plus jamais jou&#233; de r&#244;le d&#233;terminant parmi les nations du monde. Or, ses r&#233;percussions sur l'Histoire sont ind&#233;niables : gr&#226;ce &#224; ses conqu&#234;tes, la Mac&#233;doine a r&#233;pandu la culture hell&#233;nique sur toute la M&#233;diterran&#233;e occidentale et tout le Proche-Orient, influen&#231;ant ainsi le d&#233;veloppement de cette grande r&#233;gion durant de nombreuses ann&#233;es.

		<German>[H1]Makedonien[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Makedonien ist eine n&#246;rdlich von Griechenland, &#246;stlich von Illyrien und westlich von Thrakien gelegene Region im Balkan. Die Makedonen wurden von den Griechen in der Antike traditionell als Barbaren betrachtet, dennoch gelang es ihnen, unter dem Regiment einiger herausragender Heerf&#252;hrer nicht nur Griechenland zu unterwerfen, sondern auch fast das gesamte Gebiet des Nahen Ostens. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Makedonien war seit mindestens 3500 vor Christus von Menschen besiedelt. Der erste bekannte Herrscher des Reiches war K&#246;nig Karanos, der um etwa 800 vor Christus regierte. In den ersten Jahren war Makedonien den griechischen Stadtstaaten im S&#252;den deutlich unterlegen, daher verfolgten die makedonischen K&#246;nige eine Au&#223;enpolitik, die darauf abzielte, die griechischen St&#228;dte gegeneinander auszuspielen und gleichzeitig deren Kultur und milit&#228;risches Wissen zu &#252;bernehmen. Im Laufe der Zeit gewannen Karanos Nachfahren weitere Territorialgebiete hinzu und errichteten ein vereintes K&#246;nigreich, das an St&#228;rke und Zusammenhalt gewann, w&#228;hrend die Griechen durch die permanenten K&#228;mpfe, die sie untereinander f&#252;hrten, immer schw&#228;cher wurden. Bis zum 4. Jahrhundert vor Christus war Makedonien stark genug geworden, um seine Nachbarl&#228;nder herauszufordern, und das mit aller Macht. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Unter der F&#252;hrung von Philipp II., der von 359 bis 336 vor Christus regierte, erk&#228;mpften sich die Makedonen ihren Platz in der Geschichte. Philipp verbrachte den Gro&#223;teil seiner fr&#252;hen Regentschaft mit der St&#228;rkung seiner Streitkr&#228;fte, bis ihnen kaum noch jemand standhalten konnte, und wandte sich dann dem Angriff auf die reichen Stadtstaaten Griechenlands im Norden zu. Die fassungslosen Griechen erkannten schlie&#223;lich, welche Gefahr ihnen drohte und verb&#252;ndeten sich gegen die Makedonen, doch im Jahr 338 vor Christus wurden sie in der Schlacht von Chaironeia entscheidend geschlagen. Zur Sicherung seiner Vorherrschaft in dieser Region baute Philipp vier Festungen in Griechenland. Als N&#228;chstes hatte er den Einmarsch in Persien im Osten geplant, wurde jedoch ermordet (336 vor Christus), bevor er den Feldzug beginnen konnte. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Die Nachfolge Philipps II. trat sein junger Sohn Alexander an (Herrscher von 336 bis 323 vor Christus). Nach Philipps Tod begannen die Griechen zu rebellieren, weil sie der Auffassung waren, der neue makedonische Herrscher sei zu jung und unerfahren, um sie aufhalten zu k&#246;nnen. Dies sollte sich jedoch als gro&#223;er Irrtum herausstellen: Alexander schaffte es problemlos, den Aufruhr niederzuschlagen und strafte die Griechen eindrucksvoll ab, indem er die antike Stadt Theben dem Erdboden gleichmachte. Anschlie&#223;end marschierte der junge Kriegerk&#246;nig in Persien ein und erf&#252;llte nicht nur, sondern &#252;bertraf sogar die Ziele seines verstorbenen Vaters mit einem spektakul&#228;ren Eroberungsfeldzug, der sich &#252;ber das gesamte Gebiet des Nahen Ostens erstreckte. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]In nur wenigen Jahren bezwang Alexander die persische Armee in drei vernichtenden Schlachten, wobei er immer einer deutlich &#252;berlegenen Streitmacht gegen&#252;berstand. Seine erstaunlichen Siege sind auf eine Reihe von Faktoren zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren: Seine Truppen bestanden aus professionellen K&#228;mpfern, die gut ausger&#252;stet, bestens ausgebildet und enorm motiviert waren. Au&#223;erdem war Alexander selbst ein au&#223;ergew&#246;hnlich guter Stratege und Taktiker. Als h&#246;chst charismatischer Anf&#252;hrer war er zudem vollkommen furchtlos, f&#252;hrte seine M&#228;nner stets selbst an vorderster Front an und war immer mitten im Kampfgeschehen anzutreffen. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Durch die vollst&#228;ndige, irreparable Zerschlagung der persischen Truppen brachte Alexander schlie&#223;lich das gesamte Persische Reich unter seine alleinige Kontrolle (ganz zu schweigen vom persischen Vasallenstaat &#196;gypten). Auf der Suche nach weiterem Ruhm fasste er nun die im Osten liegenden reichen L&#228;ndereien Indiens ins Auge. Er &#252;berquerte den Indus und begann, gegen die indischen Truppen zu k&#228;mpfen, doch sein Feldzug kam bald zum Erliegen, nicht etwa wegen des feindlichen Widerstands, sondern weil seine eigenen M&#228;nner ersch&#246;pft waren, Heimweh hatten und ihren Anf&#252;hrer anflehten, kehrt machen und endlich zu ihren Familien zur&#252;ckkehren zu d&#252;rfen. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Als Alexander im Jahr 323 vor Christus im Alter von 33 Jahren starb, erstreckte sich sein Herrschaftsgebiet vom Balkan bis nach Indien. Ein derartig gigantisches Territorium konnte unm&#246;glich von nur einem einzelnen Mann kontrolliert werden und so wurde Alexanders Reich zwischen seinen fr&#252;heren Gener&#228;len aufgeteilt. Bis 300 vor Christus hatten sich drei gro&#223;e Staaten herausgebildet, die jeweils von Antigonos (Griechenland und Makedonien), Ptolem&#228;us (&#196;gypten) und Seleukos (Kleinasien) regiert wurden. Diese Nachfolgereiche blieben auch in den darauf folgenden Jahrhunderten unter der Herrschaft der makedonischen Nachfahren dieser Feldherren aus Alexanders fr&#252;herer Streitmacht. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Sp&#228;ter eroberten die R&#246;mer nicht nur Makedonien, sondern auch alle &#252;brigen Gebiete des ehemaligen Reiches von Alexander dem Gro&#223;en. Makedonien sollte nie wieder eine vorherrschende Rolle in der Welt einnehmen, dennoch ist sein Einfluss aus geschichtlicher Sicht nicht zu untersch&#228;tzen: Durch die makedonischen Eroberungen hielt die griechische Kultur Einzug in den &#246;stlichen Mittelmeerraum sowie den Nahen Osten und beeinflusste &#252;ber viele Jahre hinweg die weitere Entwicklung dieser bedeutenden Region.

		<Italian>[H1]La Macedonia[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]La Macedonia &#232; una regione dei Balcani situata a nord della Grecia, a est dell'Illiria e a ovest della Tracia. Anche se dagli antichi Greci venivano considerati dei barbari, guidati da una serie di generali eccezionali, i Macedoni riuscirono alla fine a dominare la Grecia stessa e quasi tutto il Vicino e Medio Oriente. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Le prime testimonianze umane in Macedonia risalgono almeno al 3500 a.C. Il primo re della regione di cui si hanno notizie &#232; Carano, che regn&#242; intorno all'800 a.C. Inizialmente la Macedonia era molto pi&#249; debole delle citt&#224;-stato greche a sud e cos&#236; i re macedoni seguirono tutti la stessa politica di metterle l'una contro l'altra, assorbendo nel frattempo la cultura e le conoscenze militari greche. Col tempo, i successori di Carano espansero il regno e lo unificarono, facendolo crescere in potenza e coesione proprio mentre le citt&#224;-stato greche si indebolivano sempre di pi&#249; per via delle lotte intestine. Cos&#236;, nel quarto secolo avanti Cristo, la Macedonia divenne abbastanza forte da poter sfidare le sue vicine... e lo fece, senza alcuna esitazione. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Fu sotto il regno di Filippo II, che govern&#242; dal 359 al 336, che i Macedoni salirono sul palco della storia. Filippo impieg&#242; i primi anni del suo regno per rafforzare al massimo il suo esercito, quindi rivolse l'attenzione a sud e attacc&#242; le ricche citt&#224;-stato greche. I Greci, presi alla sprovvista dalla minaccia macedone, finalmente misero da parte le loro beghe ma furono alla fine sconfitti nel 338 nella battaglia di Cheronea. Filippo cre&#242; quattro fortezze in tutta la Grecia per assicurarsi il dominio della regione, quindi rivolse la sua attenzione a est, ma fu assassinato (336) prima di poter dare il via alla campagna contro la Persia. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]A Filippo succedette il giovane figlio Alessandro (che govern&#242; dal 336 al 323 a.C). Dopo la morte di Filippo, i Greci si ribellarono, credendo che il nuovo sovrano macedone fosse troppo giovane e inesperto per contrastarli. Fu ovviamente un grande errore di valutazione. Alessandro schiacci&#242; i rivoltosi con facilit&#224;, per di pi&#249; radendo al suolo l'antica citt&#224; di Tebe per punire i Greci. Il giovane re guerriero invase poi la Persia andando al di l&#224; persino dei sogni del padre, portando avanti una spettacolare campagna di conquista e giungendo fino in India. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Nel giro di pochi anni Alessandro annient&#242; l'esercito persiano in tre battaglie decisive, affrontando ogni volta eserciti pi&#249; numerosi del suo. Le sorprendenti vittorie di Alessandro si devono a una serie di fattori: i suoi soldati erano professionisti, ottimamente addestrati e bene equipaggiati, oltre a essere enormemente motivati. Inoltre, lo stesso Alessandro era uno straordinario stratega e un leader estremamente carismatico e intrepido, sempre in prima linea a guidare i suoi uomini nel cuore della battaglia. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Annientato l'esercito persiano, Alessandro si ritrov&#242; a capo dell'intero Impero persiano (senza contare l'Egitto, allora stato vassallo dei Persiani). In cerca di ulteriore gloria, Alessandro rivolse il suo sguardo ancora pi&#249; a est, alle ricche terre d'India. Attravers&#242; il fiume Indo ed ebbe il tempo di scontrarsi con l'esercito indiano quando la sua avanzata venne fermata, non dal nemico, ma dalle sue stesse truppe, esauste e desiderose di tornare in patria, che di fatto lo costrinsero a fermarsi e a tornare indietro. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Quando mor&#236; (323), all'et&#224; di appena 33 anni Alessandro controllava un vasto impero che si estendeva dai Balcani all'India. Un simile impero era troppo vasto per essere governato da un qualsiasi altro uomo e cos&#236; i suoi ex generali decisero di dividerselo tra loro. Nel 300 a.C. si erano formati tre grandi stati, governati inizialmente da Antigono (Grecia e Macedonia), Tolomeo (Egitto) e Seleuco (Asia Minore) e successivamente dai loro discendenti macedoni per molti secoli. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Alla fine i Romani conquistarono la Macedonia e tutti i territori un tempo sotto la guida di Alessandro e da allora la Macedonia non ha pi&#249; giocato un ruolo di primo piano nella storia. Tuttavia le conseguenze di quel periodo non vanno sottovalutate: grazie alle loro conquiste, i Macedoni diffusero la cultura ellenica nel Mediterraneo orientale e nel Vicino Oriente, influenzando lo sviluppo di quella regione per molti secoli a venire.

Filipo pas&#243; los primeros a&#241;os de su gobierno reforzando el ej&#233;rcito y, una vez estuvo seguro de que no hab&#237;a nadie que pudiera hacerle frente, se volvi&#243; hacia el sur y atac&#243; a las opulentas ciudades-estado de Grecia. Los sorprendidos griegos reconocieron finalmente el peligro y se unieron frente a la amenaza macedonia, pero sufrieron una derrota decisiva en la batalla de Queronea (338 a. C.).

A la muerte de Filipo, los estados griegos, creyendo que el nuevo se&#241;or de Macedonia era demasiado joven e inexperto como para detenerlos, se levantaron. Fue un terrible error: Alejandro aplast&#243; la revuelta con facilidad y arras&#243; hasta los cimientos la antiqu&#237;sima ciudad de Tebas para castigar a los griegos. A continuaci&#243;n, el joven rey invadi&#243; Persia, donde alcanz&#243;, y m&#225;s adelante super&#243;, los objetivos de su padre en una espectacular campa&#241;a de conquista que recorri&#243; Oriente Pr&#243;ximo de un lado a otro. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]En cuesti&#243;n de pocos a&#241;os Alejandro aplast&#243; al imperio persa en tres batallas decisivas, libradas frente a ej&#233;rcitos superiores en n&#250;mero. Las asombrosas victorias de Alejandro pueden atribuirse a varios factores: sus tropas eran profesionales y estaban bien equipadas, muy bien entrenadas y enormemente motivadas. Por otro lado, Alejandro era un extraordinario estratega. Adem&#225;s de poseer un carisma sin igual, no conoc&#237;a el miedo y siempre dirig&#237;a a sus hombres desde primera l&#237;nea, sin rehuir el combate. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Una vez destruido el ej&#233;rcito persa, Alejandro se encontr&#243; con el imperio entero en sus manos (adem&#225;s de Egipto, que por entonces era un estado vasallo de Persia). Hambriento de gloria, Alejandro dirigi&#243; su mirada m&#225;s al este, hacia las ricas tierras de la India. Cruz&#243; el Indo y se enfrent&#243; a las tropas indias, pero su campa&#241;a se detuvo... no por culpa del enemigo, sino por sus propias tropas que, enfermas de nostalgia y agotamiento, le suplicaron que diera la vuelta y los dejara volver con sus familias. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]A su muerte, en el 323 a. C. (cuando contaba 33 a&#241;os), Alejandro controlaba un vasto imperio que se extend&#237;a de los Balcanes a la India. Un territorio tan enorme era demasiado para que lo controlara un solo hombre, as&#237; que los antiguos generales del macedonio se lo repartieron. En el 300 a. C. exist&#237;an ya tres estados consolidados, controlados por Ant&#237;oco (que gobernaba Grecia y Macedonia), Ptolomeo (Egipto) y Seleuco (Asia Menor). Los descendientes macedonios de los generales de Alejandro gobernar&#237;an durante siglos estos tres imperios. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Finalmente, los romanos acabar&#237;an por conquistar Macedonia y los dem&#225;s territorios de Alejandro, y Macedonia no volver&#237;a a desempe&#241;ar un papel de importancia entre los pa&#237;ses del mundo. Pero su influencia hist&#243;rica no debe subestimarse: mediante sus conquistas, Macedonia difundi&#243; la cultura helen&#237;stica por todo el Mediterr&#225;neo oriental y Oriente Pr&#243;ximo e influy&#243; en el desarrollo de esta importante regi&#243;n durante muchos a&#241;os.

		<German>Schon fr&#252;h nachweisbar ist das Pekulienwesen des r&#246;mischen Reiches, das dem Sklaven gestattete, aus seinem Nebenverdienst eigenes Verm&#246;gen (peculium) zu bilden. Gleichwohl handelte es sich juristisch um Eigentum des pater familias, der es seinem Sklaven lediglich freiwillig belie&#223;. Das peculium er&#246;ffnete dem Sklaven jedoch die M&#246;glichkeit sich loszukaufen. Es gab verschiedene Arten der Freilassung (manumissio) von Sklaven. M&#246;glich waren unter anderem:[NEWLINE]Letztwillige Verf&#252;gung im Testament (per testamentum) durch den Herrn[NEWLINE]Rechtsakt vor dem Magistrat (per vindictam)[NEWLINE]Eintragung durch den Zensor in die B&#252;rgerrolle als freier B&#252;rger (per censum)[NEWLINE]Zusendung eines Freibriefs durch den Herrn (per epistulam)[NEWLINE]oder durch eine einfache Willenserkl&#228;rung des Herrn in Gegenwart Dritter (inter amicos, per mensam, per convivium)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In Rom hatten freigelassene Sklaven (liberti) zwar das B&#252;rgerrecht im Gegensatz zu vielen griechischen Staaten , waren als Klienten aber immer noch von dem Patron, der sie freigelassen hatte, abh&#228;ngig und wurden von ihrem ehemaligen Herrn besch&#252;tzt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In der fr&#252;hen Kaiserzeit nahm die Zahl der Freilassungen so stark zu, dass Kaiser Augustus Gesetze erlie&#223;, welche die Freilassung einschr&#228;nkten. So musste ein Sklave mindestens 30 Jahre alt sein, um freigelassen werden zu k&#246;nnen. Trotzdem stieg die Zahl der Freigelassenen weiter an.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Die Behandlung der Sklaven gab durch Willk&#252;r und Grausamkeit wiederholt Anlass zu blutigen Sklavenaufst&#228;nden im r&#246;mischen Reich und drei Sklavenkriegen. Insbesondere war es der Spartacus-Aufstand (73 bis 71 v. Chr.), der f&#252;r Rom gef&#228;hrliche Ausma&#223;e annahm.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Andererseits gab es in der r&#246;mischen Rechtsprechung den Begriff des Scheinsklaven (bona fide serviens), eines Freien, der sich als Sklave ausgab, um schlechten Lebensumst&#228;nden oder dem Milit&#228;rdienst zu entgehen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Milderungen der Sklaverei sind schon sehr fr&#252;h nachweisbar, anfangs &#252;ber die soziale Kontrolle durch andere Sklavenherren, sp&#228;ter zunehmend durch rechtliche Beschr&#228;nkungen der Herrengewalt. Seit der Sp&#228;tantike ging die Sklaverei in Mitteleuropa zur&#252;ck und wurde teilweise vom Kolonat abgel&#246;st, das sich durch Vermischung des bei den Germanen herrschenden Systems aus Freien und Unfreien zum System der Leibeigenschaft weiterentwickelte. Leibeigenen Bauern, die von einem Adligen abhingen, war es verboten, ihr Land zu verlassen. Sie waren zu zahlreichen Arbeitsleistungen und hohen Abgaben gegen&#252;ber ihrem Herrn verpflichtet.</German>

		<Spanish>La esclavitud en la Antigua Roma constitu&#237;a una de las caracter&#237;sticas de la sociedad romana. A lo largo de toda la historia del Imperio romano y su dominio sobre el Mediterr&#225;neo, Europa, &#193;frica y Asia, la sociedad romana fue esencialmente esclavista, y tanto su econom&#237;a como su estructura social se basaba en un sistema de clases donde el esclavo constitu&#237;a el escal&#243;n m&#225;s bajo de la sociedad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La mayor&#237;a de los esclavos en la antigua Roma se adquir&#237;an a trav&#233;s de las guerras, los ej&#233;rcitos romanos llevan los prisioneros de vuelta como parte de la recompensa de la guerra.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Delante del templo de Pietas, estaba la columna lactaria, donde eran depositados, expuestos, es decir ius exponendi, los beb&#233;s abandonados, es decir, los que el pater familias se negaba a reconocer, para que alguien los adoptara. Esto casi nunca ocurr&#237;a, sino que los recog&#237;an personas que los convert&#237;an en esclavos si eran hombres, y en prostitutas si eran mujeres. Los ni&#241;os in&#250;tiles, deformes o d&#233;biles eran eliminados. El ni&#241;o adoptado tomaba el apellido del nuevo padre. Cuando una esclava ten&#237;a un hijo, era responsabilidad de su amo aceptarlo en la familia. Que lo matara si no era aceptado no estaba mal visto, aunque m&#225;s tarde pudo llegar a tener un tipo de reprobaci&#243;n moral.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dentro del imperio, los esclavos eran vendidos en subasta p&#250;blica o, a veces en las tiendas, o por venta privada para los esclavos m&#225;s valiosos. La trata de esclavos fue supervisada por los funcionarios fiscales romanos llamados Cuestores.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A veces los esclavos estaban expuestos en soportes rotativos, para ser mejor observados y junto a cada esclavo iba colgado para la venta un tipo de placa que describe su origen, la salud, car&#225;cter, inteligencia, educaci&#243;n, y otra informaci&#243;n pertinente para los compradores. Para poder apreciar mejor sus cualidades y defectos siempre eran expuestos desnudos. Los precios variaban con la edad y la calidad, asi los ni&#241;os esclavos eran m&#225;s baratos que los adultos, y entre estos &#250;ltimos los m&#225;s valiosos alcanzaban precios equivalentes a miles de d&#243;lares de hoy d&#237;a. A modo de garant&#237;a, el concesionario estaba obligado a reemplazar con un esclavo nuevo dentro de los seis meses tras la compra, si el esclavo ten&#237;a defectos ocultos que no se manifestaron en la venta. Los esclavos puestos a la venta sin periodo de garant&#237;a estaban obligados a llevar una gorra en la subasta, y eran m&#225;s baratos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La vida como esclavo depend&#237;a en gran medida del tipo general de trabajo que se le asignaba, del que hab&#237;a una gran variedad. Para los esclavos, la asignaci&#243;n de las minas era a menudo una sentencia de muerte lenta. A los esclavos agr&#237;colas (familia rustica) generalmente les iba mejor, mientras que los esclavos dom&#233;sticos de las familias ricas de Roma (familia urbana) probablemente disfrutaban del m&#225;s alto nivel de vida de los esclavos romanos, junto a los esclavos de propiedad p&#250;blica (servus publicus) que no estaban sujetos a los caprichos de un solo amo. A pesar de que su alojamiento y comida eran de una calidad notoriamente inferior a la de los miembros libres de la familia, puede haber sido comparable a la de muchos romanos libres, pero pobres. Esclavos dom&#233;sticos se podian encontrar trabajando como peluqueros, mayordomos, cocineros, empleadas dom&#233;sticas, enfermeros, maestros, secretarios y costureras. Esclavos con m&#225;s educaci&#243;n e inteligencia pod&#237;an trabajar en profesiones tales como la contabilidad, la educaci&#243;n y la medicina.</Spanish>

Auch Familienmitglieder wurden in die Sklaverei verkauft, um Schulden zu tilgen. Es gab doppelt so viele Sklavinnen wie Sklaven, weil vorwiegend Frauen im Haushalt besch&#228;ftigt wurden. Auf den Feldern der Kleinbauern arbeiteten kaum Sklaven, weil sie zu teuer f&#252;r die Familien waren. Sklaven wurden auch als Nebenfrauen erworben, falls die Ehefrau kinderlos blieb.

		<English>[TAB]A senate is an assembly of the eldest and wiser members of the ruling class of society. Two of the first official senates were the Spartan Gerousia and the Roman Senate. The most famous senate was the one of the Roman Republic. The senate passed decrees called senatus consultum, which in form constituted "advice" from the senate to a magistrate. While these advices did not hold legal force, they usually were obeyed in practice. If a senatus consultum conflicted with a law that was passed by an Assembly, the law overrode the senatus consultum, because the senatus consultum had its authority based in precedent, and not in law. A senatus consultum, however, could serve to interpret a law.

Auch die meisten anderen griechischen Stadtstaaten kannten vom Adel beherrscht &#196;ltestenr&#228;te. Solche &#196;ltestenr&#228;te standen immer neben den eigentlichen Volksversammlungen und neben den Amtstr&#228;gern, die die Beschl&#252;sse umsetzten. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Der r&#246;mische Senat ist der bekannteste dieser &#196;ltestenr&#228;te. Er war das wichtigste Organ der R&#246;mischen Republik und bestand in der Kaiserzeit zwar fort, nur lange nicht mehr mit so viel Macht ausgestattet wie in der Republik. Nur ehemalige Konsuln oder hohe Regierungsbeamte durften eintreten. Anfangs war die Aufnahme auf Leute beschr&#228;nkt, die schon einmal alleinverantwortlich ein milit&#228;risches Oberkommando hatten, und erst sp&#228;ter auch auf Verwaltungsbeamte ausgedehnt. Senator blieb man auf Lebenszeit; ein Gehalt bezogen die Senatoren nicht; ihnen war verboten, Gewerbe zu treiben. Somit grenzte sich der Kreis der Senatoren auf die klitzekleine Gro&#223;grundbesitzerschicht ein. &#196;u&#223;erliche Zeichen der der Senatoren waren ein breiter Purpurstreifen auf der Tunika und ein Symbolum (Siegelring). Abgesandte fremder V&#246;lker beschrieben ihren Eindruck von einem Besuch im R&#246;mischen Senat einmal als "Versammlung von K&#246;nigen." [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Es gab keinerlei Verfassung, in der die Rolle des Senates festgeschrieben war. Der Respekt vor Senatsbeschl&#252;ssen war Traditionssache.

Trotzdem machte der Senat de facto die Au&#223;enpolitik und kontrollierte die Staatsfinanzen. Die Konsuln und anderen Magistrate wurden zwar nicht vom Senat, sondern von der Volksversammlung gew&#228;hlt, h&#228;tten aber nicht gewagt, sich gegen Senatsbeschl&#252;sse zu stellen. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Der Senat umfasste in der Zeit der fr&#252;hen Republik etwa 100, sp&#228;ter etwa 300, in der Zeit C&#228;sars sogar bis zu 900 Sitze. In der fr&#252;hen Kaiserzeit wurde die Anzahl der Senatoren wieder auf etwa 600 reduziert. Unter den Kaisern blieb der Senat ein exklusiver verein mit eigenen Logen im Kolosseum, verlor aber immer mehr an Einfluss auf die Reichspolitik und verkam zu einer Art Stadtrat der Stadt Rom. Er &#252;berdauerte noch das Ende des westlichen Kaisertums 476 und verschwand endg&#252;ltig erst um das Jahr 600.</German>

Despite the word's negative connotations, a leader doesn't necessarily have to be a corrupt, evil megalomaniac to be a despot; it is possible to be a benevolent despot, though history records few cases of such. [PARAGRAPH:2]The strength of this form of government is that the ruler can easily implement his decisions; he does not need to compromise, cajole, or bribe anyone to get the job done. The weakness of this form of government is that the ruler can implement bad decisions just as easily as good ones; with no checks and balances, how can he be stopped? Also, there is a lot of truth in the old saying, "Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely." And though as said before, despots don't need to be corrupt, evil megalomaniacs, many of them end up that way.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Hereditary Rule is a form of government wherein the rulership is passed down from one member of the family to the next. This kind of succession is most often associated with monarchical rulers, but it occasionally appears in despotisms or even purportedly communist regimes, North Korea, for example. There is often a religious justification for hereditary rule; kings are said to rule by "divine right" or "the mandate of Heaven." [PARAGRAPH:2]The strength of hereditary rule is that there is usually a clear line of succession, and thus perhaps less squabbling for power when the current monarch dies. (There are plenty of exceptions to this rule throughout history, of course.) Further, there may be a certain amount of familial pressure on the ruler to not mess things up too badly for the next generation. However, hereditary rule suffers the same kind of weaknesses as do all unelected rulers; the leader is not answerable to the people, and it can be extremely difficult to get rid of a bad one.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Slavery is a system whereby some people are judged far inferior to others and are treated as objects or possessions, with no more rights than those afforded to chairs or cattle. Slavery has existed as long as human history, from the earliest primitive times to the enlightened days of Greece and Rome and right up until today. Sometimes convicted criminals were made into slaves. Sometimes captured enemies of the state were enslaved. Sometimes people of a specific race or coloration were enslaved. In some civilizations a person could purchase their freedom or were allotted it after being enslaved for a specific period of time. [PARAGRAPH:2]The advantage of slavery is that it allows people to be forced to do jobs that they would otherwise refuse to do without adequate compensation. Cheap labor results in concentration of wealth and thus the creation of great buildings and temples or the maintenance of large professional armies. Aside from its basic moral repugnance, the disadvantages of slavery are numerous: it corrupts both slave and master, it badly underutilizes the intelligence and creativity of the subject people, and it almost inevitably leads to revolts and internal strife.</English>

Dans certaines civilisations, les individus pouvaient racheter leur libert&#233;, ou la r&#233;cup&#233;raient automatiquement apr&#232;s un certain de temps. [PARAGRAPH:2]L'avantage de l'esclavage est qu'il permet de forcer des gens &#224; accomplir certaines t&#226;ches qu'ils auraient sinon refus&#233;es de faire sans &#234;tre correctement r&#233;mun&#233;r&#233;s. Cette main-d'oeuvre bon march&#233; permet de concentrer la richesse et de cr&#233;er de somptueux b&#226;timents et lieux de culte ou d'entretenir de vastes arm&#233;es. En plus d'&#234;tre moralement r&#233;pugnant, l'esclavage a de nombreux inconv&#233;nients : il corrompt autant le ma&#238;tre que l'esclave, il sous-exploite l'intelligence et la cr&#233;ativit&#233; des individus soumis, et conduit presque in&#233;vitablement &#224; la r&#233;volte et aux conflits internes.</French>

Sklaven waren in der Regel verurteilte Verbrecher, Kriegsgefangene, Angeh&#246;rige anderer V&#246;lker oder Menschen einer bestimmten Hautfarbe. In einigen Kulturen konnte sich ein Sklave freikaufen oder wurde von seinem Herrn freigelassen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der Vorteil der Sklaverei liegt auf der Hand: Sklaven sind billige Arbeitskr&#228;fte, die entscheidend zum Wohlstand ihrer Herren beitrugen. Letztere waren dadurch in der Lage, gewaltige Tempel zu errichten oder stehende Heere zu unterhalten. Abgesehen vom moralischen Aspekt hat die Sklaverei allerdings einen entscheidenden Nachteil: Sie f&#252;hrt fast immer zu inneren Spannungen und Aufst&#228;nden.</German>

The specific rights and obligations of masters and serfs vary significantly over time and from place to place. In some societies, the master had the right to control every aspect of a serf's life except that he couldn't kill the serf without just cause; in others, the serfs had the rights to marry and to inherit wealth and to a certain amount of self-government, but they could not leave the land without their lord's permission. [PARAGRAPH:2]The basic premise of serfdom is that one group of people are superior to another, and that they have the political and god-given right to control the other group's destiny. Thus serfdom only makes sense if one agrees with the group currently in power about who is superior to whom.</English>

Dans certaines soci&#233;t&#233;s, le ma&#238;tre avait le droit de contr&#244;ler tous les aspects de la vie du serf, mais ne pouvait pas le tuer sans raison. Ailleurs, les serfs avaient le droit de se marier, de transmettre leur patrimoine et disposaient d'une certaine autonomie, mais ils ne pouvaient pas quitter leur terre sans l'accord de leur seigneur.

The State owns the factories, the farms, the universities, the grocery stores and virtually everything else.

Each person would contribute his or her best to the State; in return the State would distribute its largess according to each citizen's needs. Unfortunately, state property is quite a bit less fair when applied in real life. The State determines what each person gets, but often those decisions are based upon the citizen's political orthodoxy, family connections, or ability to pay bribes.

Laut dieser Theorie ist es Gottes Wille, dass diese M&#228;nner die Regierung leiten, und eine andere politische Meinung ist eine S&#252;nde und Starrk&#246;pfigkeit, wenn nicht sogar Ketzerei.

[PARAGRAPH:2]Nel mondo moderno, le teocrazie tendono a guardare indietro, nel tentativo di riportare la propria nazione in qualche mitico stato di grazia appartenente al passato, lontano dal male e dalla corruzione. Per alcune nazioni, la diplomazia tende ad essere molto difficoltosa: se un paese agisce contro gli interessi di una teocrazia viene visto come un gesto del diavolo, piuttosto che una necessit&#224; e un differente punto di vista.

En teor&#237;a, es voluntad de Dios que el gobierno est&#233; en sus manos, y el disenso pol&#237;tico es pecaminoso y moralmente condenable, cuando no directamente her&#233;tico.

There is no state religion; the government is totally secular. [PARAGRAPH:2]Such states allow all to express their religious beliefs. This encourages immigration by people whose religions are suppressed elsewhere, and the general society benefits from the multitude of experiences and beliefs of its members. However, such freedom and tolerance of religions may weaken a nation's people's beliefs in any religion, which could cause the people to become morally lax and decadent. Further, members of the more militant and expansionist religions may seek to destroy the competition, causing a good deal of stress and conflict within a country.

Born in the "cradle of religions," the Middle East, Judaism provided the foundations for Christianity and Islam, two other "Abrahamic" religions. [PARAGRAPH:2]Judaism is the religion of the Jews, originally a Semitic tribe that lived in an area of the Middle East roughly centered on the ancient city of Jerusalem. Over time their central beliefs were written down in the Bible (Old Testament), which contains the history of the Jews, as well as the words of prophets and kings. Most importantly, the Bible teaches the children of Israel how to live according to God's wishes. [PARAGRAPH:2]These are the central beliefs of Judaism. There is only one God and you must not worship any other gods before Him. God is all powerful, all knowing, and eternal. Each man prays to God directly, without the need for an intermediary. People can atone for sins through words and deeds. God has chosen the Jewish people to be in a covenant with Him, and some day God will send a Messiah to bring all of the chosen people back to Israel and usher in an era of peace and prosperity to the Earth. [PARAGRAPH:2]Judaism is a remarkably strong and resilient faith. Throughout history the Jews have been oppressed and enslaved by a series of conquerors. They have been taken from their homeland and scattered across Europe, Africa and Asia. They have been the targets of a program of unbelievably brutal genocide. But throughout it all, the Jews have remained faithful to their religion and their God.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Christianity is the world's largest religion. It is the dominant religion in Europe, North, Central and South America, and has made significant inroads in all other parts of the world. Christianity is based upon the teachings of Jesus Christ, whom Christians believe to have been the "son of God made flesh," brought to the world to teach men the way of salvation. Jesus lived from approximately 6 BC to 30 AD. [PARAGRAPH:2]Jesus' life and teachings are recorded in the New Testament. Born of the Virgin Mary, a Jew, the Christ lived and taught in and around present-day Palestine and Israel. According to the New Testament, he performed many miracles during his lifetime, and he taught men how to cleanse themselves from sin and thus achieve eternal happiness after death. Jesus was betrayed and crucified, but he rose from death after three days and ascended into heaven. [PARAGRAPH:2]After Christ's death, Christianity spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean. The Romans tried unsuccessfully to suppress it, but eventually they adopted Christianity as the state religion. With the might of Rome behind it, Christianity spread rapidly through the known world. When the Roman Empire fell, Christianity broke into two branches. Since then it has continued to fragment, with a number of the branches quite hostile to others. Today, the major Christian branches include Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Orthodox Christianity, and Mormonism.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The gods of Sumer were human in form and maintained human traits. They ate, drank, married, and fought amongst each other. Even though the gods were immortal and all-powerful, it was apparent that they could be hurt and even killed. Each god adhered to a set of rules of divine authority known as me. The me ensured that each god was able to keep the cosmos functioning according to the plans handed down to them by Enlil. Hundreds of deities were recognized in the Sumerian pantheon. Many were wives, children, and servants of the more powerful deities. The gods were organized into a caste system. At the head of the system was the king or supreme ruler. The four most important deities were An, Enlil, Enki, and Ninhursag. These were the four creator deities who created all of the other gods. An was initially the head of the pantheon, though he was eventually seceded by Enlil. Enlil is seen as the most important god. He is known as "the king of heaven and earth," "the father of the gods," and "the king of all the gods." Enlil developed the broad designs for the universe. However, it was Enki who further developed and carried out his plans. Ninhursag was regarded as the mother of all living beings. Under the four creator deities were the seven gods who "decree the fates." These were An, Enlil, Enki, Ninhursag, Nanna, Utu, and Inanna. These were followed by the 50 "great gods" or Annunaki, the children of An. The Sumerians originally practiced a polytheistic religion, with anthropomorphic deities representing cosmic and terrestrial forces in their world. During the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, Sumerian deities became more anthrocentric and were nature gods transformed into city gods. Gods like Enki and Inanna were viewed as having been assigned their rank, power and knowledge from An, the heaven deity, or Enlil, head of the Sumerian pantheon. This cosmological shift may have been caused by the growing influence of the neighboring Akkadian religion, or as a result of increased warfare between the Sumerian city-states; the assignment of certain powers to deities may have mirrored the appointment of the Lugals, who were given power and authority by the city-state and its priesthood. The majority of Sumerian deities belonged to a classification called the Anunna (offspring of An), whereas seven deities, including Enlil and Inanna, belonged to a group of underworld judges" known as the Anunnaki (offspring of An + Ki). During the Third Dynasty of Ur, the Sumerian pantheon included sixty times sixty (3600) deities. The main Sumerian deities were: An (God of heaven/the firmament), Enlil (God of the air and patron deity of Nippur), Enki (God of freshwater, male fertility, and knowledge; plus patron deity of Eridu), Inanna (Goddess of sexual love, female fertility and warfare; plus matron deity of Uruk), Ki (Goddess of the earth), Nanna (God of the moon and one of the patron deities of Ur), Ningal (Wife of Nanna), Ninlil (An air goddess and wife of Enlil, plus one of the matron deities of Nippur. She also was believed to reside in the same temple as Enlil), Ninurta (God of war, agriculture, one of the Sumerian wind gods, plus patron deity of Girsu as well as one of the patron deities of Lagash), Utu (God of the sun at the Ebarbara temple of Sippar). Some stories in Sumerian religion appear similar to stories in other Middle-Eastern religions. For example, the biblical account of the Noahs flood myth resembles some aspects of the Sumerian deluge myth. The Judaic underworld Sheol is very similar in description with the Sumerian and Babylonian Kigal. Sumerian scholar Samuel Noah Kramer noted similarities between many Sumerian and Akkadian "proverbs" and the later Hebrew proverbs, many of which are featured in the Book of Proverbs.</English>

		<Spanish>[TAB]La religi&#243;n sumeria se refiere a la mitolog&#237;a, pante&#243;n, cosmolog&#237;a y ritos de la civilizaci&#243;n sumeria. La religi&#243;n sumeria influenci&#243; a toda la mitolog&#237;a mesopot&#225;mica, sobreviviendo en las mitolog&#237;as y religiones de los hurritas, acadios, babilonios, asirios y otros grupos culturales.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mitolog&#237;a mesopot&#225;mica, es el nombre colectivo dado a las mitolog&#237;as de las civilizaciones mesopot&#225;micas anteriores a la civilizaci&#243;n persa: sumeria, acadia, asiria ybabil&#243;nica.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los sumerios practicaron una religi&#243;n polite&#237;sta, con dioses antropom&#243;rficos que representaban fuerzas o presencias en el mundo, tal y como lo har&#237;a m&#225;s adelante la civilizaci&#243;n griega. En sus creencias establecen que los dioses originalmente crearon a los seres humanos para que &#233;stos les sirvieran de sirvientes, pero los liberaron cuando fueron demasiados.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Muchas historias en la religi&#243;n sumeria aparecen hom&#243;logas a las historias en otras religiones del Medio Oriente. Por ejemplo, el relato b&#237;blico de la creaci&#243;n del hombre, la cultura de Los Elamitas, as&#237; como la narrativa de la diluvio universal y el arca de No&#233; se asemeja mucho a las historias asirias. Los dioses sumerios tienen representaciones distintamente similares en religiones acadias, cananitas y de otras culturas. Algunas de las historias y deidades tambi&#233;n tienen sus paralelos griegos; por ejemplo, el descenso de Inanna al inframundo (Irkalla) se asemeja a la historia de Pers&#233;fone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El universo apareci&#243; por primera vez cuando Nammu, un abismo sin forma, se abri&#243; a s&#237; mismo y en un acto de auto-procreaci&#243;n dio nacimiento a An (Anu) (dios del cielo), y a Ki (diosa de la Tierra), referida com&#250;nmente como Ninhursag.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La uni&#243;n de Anu (An) y Ki produjo a Enlil, el se&#241;or del viento, quien eventualmente se convirti&#243; en el l&#237;der de los dioses. Despu&#233;s del destierro de Enlil de Dilmun (el hogar de los dioses) debido a la violaci&#243;n de Ninlil de la que tuvo un hijo, Sin (dios de la Luna), tambi&#233;n conocido como Nannar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sin y Ningal dieron a luz a Inanna (diosa del amor y de la guerra) y a Utu o Shamash (dios del Sol). Durante el destierro, Enlil engendr&#243; tres deidades del inframundo junto con Ninlil, el m&#225;s notable de ellos fue Nergal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nammu tambi&#233;n dio a luz a Enki o Abzu, dios del abismo acu&#225;tico. Enki tambi&#233;n control&#243; el Me, los decretos sagrados que gobernaron las cosas b&#225;sicas tales como la f&#237;sica y las cosas complejas tales como el orden y leyes sociales. Esto considera el origen de la mayor&#237;a del mundo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dentro de la mitolog&#237;a mesopot&#225;mica puede hacerse una divisi&#243;n entre las divinidades sumerias y las semitas. Primero existieron los dioses sumerios que m&#225;s tarde fueron adaptados por los acadios, babilonios, asirios, arameos y caldeos (todos ellos pueblos semitas).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La tr&#237;ada sumeria la formaban An, Enlil y Enki, que eran dioses y la tr&#237;ada semita estaba compuesta por los dioses Sin, Ishtar y Shamash, los equivalentes a la Luna, Venus y el Sol. Exist&#237;an adem&#225;s otros dioses menos tradicionales que representaban la fertilidad y la diosa madre.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el lenguaje sumerio, "Nin" significa 'se&#241;ora' y "En" significa 'se&#241;or'. Por otra parte, ki es 'tierra' y lil es 'aire'. De ah&#237; resulta sencillo saber qui&#233;n era el se&#241;or de la tierra (o dios de la tierra Enki), el se&#241;or del aire (o dios del aire Enlil), la se&#241;ora del aire (o diosa del aire Ninlil), etc.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The Greeks believed in many gods: they were polytheistic. It is impossible to say how many Greek gods there were, because different Greeks worshipped different gods. Certainly there were hundreds. The most famous of them, and the ones which the most people sacrificed to, were Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Artemis, Poseidon, Aphrodite, Athena, Demeter, Hermes, Ares, and Hades. But there were many others: Asclepius, the god of medicine, Persephone, Demeters daughter, Gaia the earth goddess, Hecate, and so forth. In addition, every little village had its own gods. The local stream, an especially big tree, an oddly shaped rock, all were thought to have their own god inside them, who had to be worshipped or he or she would get mad. Greek people also worshipped foreign gods, if for some reason they thought this might help them somehow. The Egyptian goddess Isis was especially popular in Athens in the Hellenistic period, for instance. And many Hellenistic Greeks worshipped Astarte, too. To keep their gods happy, most Greek people sacrificed to their gods. Most people in Greece also asked the gods to tell them about the future through oracles.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Charakteristisch f&#252;r die griechische Religion ist ihre Uneinheitlichkeit, die sich in der durch die landschaftliche Zergliederung Griechenlands bedingten Vielzahl der G&#246;tter und Kulte zeigt. Schon fr&#252;h stellten sich die Griechen die G&#246;tter in Menschengestalt (anthropomorph) vor. Die bedeutendsten griechischen G&#246;ttergestalten entstanden durch die Verschmelzung der religi&#246;sen Vorstellungen der &#228;g&#228;ischen Urbev&#246;lkerung und denen der ersten indoeurop&#228;ischen Einwanderer (seit 2000 v. Chr.). In der Bl&#252;tezeit der mykenischen Kultur entstand auch eine sozial bedingte Uneinheitlichkeit der griechischen Religion: Die G&#246;tter wurden dem Charakter der ritterlichen Herrenschicht angepasst, w&#228;hrend die Landbev&#246;lkerung weiter ihre alte Naturreligion pflegte. In der Folgezeit haben die Dichtungen Homers und Hesiods, der einen G&#246;tterkanon aufstellte, das Bild der griechischen Religion entscheidend gepr&#228;gt. In der homerischen Religion ist die G&#246;tterwelt rangm&#228;&#223;ig geordnet. An der Spitze stehen die auf dem Olymp wohnenden, daher olympisch genannten Zw&#246;lfg&#246;tter mit dem Hauptgott Zeus. Diesen sind viele kleinere Gottheiten untergeordnet. Die homerischen G&#246;tter sind wesensm&#228;&#223;ig den Menschen nachgezeichnet (besonders in sittlicher Hinsicht), erweisen sich ihnen gegen&#252;ber aber als die St&#228;rkeren und zeichnen sich dar&#252;ber hinaus durch Unsterblichkeit aus. Den Menschen stehen sie mit Interesse und Wohlwollen gegen&#252;ber, k&#246;nnen sie aber auch strafen (z. B. bei Verweigerung von Opfergaben, Elternmord und Hybris). &#220;ber den G&#246;ttern steht das Schicksal (Moira) und beschr&#228;nkt ihre Macht. Nach seinem Tod erwartet den Menschen ein Dasein in einer unterirdischen Welt (? Unterwelt), in der er als kraftloses und stummes Schattenbild seiner selbst ohne Bewusstsein weiterexistiert. Zum Kult geh&#246;rten Gebete (besonders Bittgebete), durch die man Kontakt mit der Gottheit herzustellen versuchte, Opfer an die G&#246;tter, f&#252;r die Gegenleistungen erwartet wurden, Weihgeschenke und rituelle Reinigungsakte. Die richtige Durchf&#252;hrung der Riten oblag den Priestern. Die G&#246;tter wurden an den verschiedenartigsten Kultst&#228;tten (von einem geweihten Stein oder Baum bis zum Tempel mit Kultbild) verehrt. Wichtig war auch das Orakelwesen, wobei vor allem das delphische Spruchorakel des Apoll Einfluss auf die ganze griechische Welt aus&#252;bte. Der G&#246;tterverehrung dienten ferner zahllose Feste; mit &#252;berregionaler Bedeutung die panhellenischen Feste, besonders die olympischen Spiele. Mangelnde Volkst&#252;mlichkeit und die d&#252;steren Jenseitsvorstellungen der homerischen Religion f&#252;hrten seit dem 7. Jahrhundert v. Chr. zur Verbreitung des Dionysoskults, der gr&#246;&#223;ere N&#228;he zur Gottheit versprach, und des Mysterienwesens, besonders in Eleusis (? Mysterien). Diese auf alten Volksglauben zur&#252;ckgehenden Kulte traten in Konkurrenz zur offiziellen Religion der Polis wie auch nachfolgend Homer noch nicht bekannte Gottheiten (Asklepios, Hekate, Kybele, Adonis). Die Kritik der Philosophie, die im Gegensatz zur griechischen Religion eine eigenst&#228;ndige Theologie entwickelte und starker orientalischer Einfluss f&#252;hrten in hellenistischer Zeit zum Untergang der altgriechischen Religion.[PARAGRAPH:2] Die r&#246;mische Religion war urspr&#252;nglich eine (nur erschlie&#223;bare) Bauern- und Hirtenreligion mit den Hauptg&#246;ttern Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus und einer Vielzahl von Sonderg&#246;ttern des Berufs und der Natur (Penaten: die Hausg&#246;tter; Janus f&#252;r die T&#252;r; Vesta f&#252;r den Herd; Terminus f&#252;r den Acker; Insitor f&#252;r das S&#228;en); neben dem Hauskult gab es den Staatskult. Das Kennzeichen dieser Religion war die Pflicht zur strengen Einhaltung der kultischen Gebr&#228;uche und Riten, die weit gehend magische Bedeutung hatten. Die r&#246;mische Religion diente, dem n&#252;chtern-praktischen Sinn der R&#246;mer entsprechend, der Verwirklichung praktischer Zwecke. Die erste &#252;berfremdung erlebte die r&#246;mische Religion durch die etruskische Religion (der Feuergott Vulkan; die G&#246;tterdreiheit Jupiter, Juno, Minerva wurde nach etruskischem Vorbild gestaltet; etruskischer Sch&#246;pfung waren Tempel und G&#246;tterbilder); eine zweite umw&#228;lzende &#252;berfremdung durch den Einfluss der &#252;berlegenen griechischen Religion und Mythologie. Sie brachten eine Vielzahl von neuen G&#246;ttern mit (Apollon, Demeter, Hermes u. a.), die den alten zugeordnet bzw. mit ihnen identifiziert wurden (Jupiter-Zeus, Juno-Hera, Neptun-Poseidon, Minerva-Athene). In sp&#228;tantiker Zeit wurden auch orientalische Kulte (Magna Mater, Isis, Attis, Serapis, Mithras) in Rom heimisch, die, zusammen mit dem Christentum, zur Aufl&#246;sung der r&#246;mischen Religion f&#252;hrten.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]I greci credevano in molti dei: erano politeisti. &#200; impossibile dire quanti dei greci c'erano, perch&#233; diversi greci adoravano divinit&#224; diverse. Certamente erano centinaia. I pi&#249; famosi di loro, e quelli a cui la maggior parte delle persone si sacrificava, erano Zeus, Era, Apollo, Artemide, Poseidone, Afrodite, Atena, Demetra, Ermes, Ares e Ade. Ma ce n'erano molti altri: Asclepio, il dio della medicina, Persefone, la figlia di Demetra, Gaia la dea della terra, Ecate e cos&#236; via. Inoltre, ogni piccolo villaggio aveva i suoi dei. Si pensava che il ruscello locale, un albero particolarmente grande, una roccia dalla forma strana, avesse il proprio dio dentro di s&#233;, che doveva essere adorato o lui o lei si sarebbe arrabbiato. Anche i greci adoravano divinit&#224; straniere, se per qualche motivo pensavano che questo potesse aiutarli in qualche modo. Ad esempio, la dea egizia Iside era particolarmente popolare ad Atene nel periodo ellenistico. E anche molti greci ellenistici adoravano Astarte. Per mantenere felici i loro dei, la maggior parte dei greci si sacrificava ai loro dei. La maggior parte delle persone in Grecia ha anche chiesto agli dei di parlare loro del futuro attraverso gli oracoli.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]Celtic mythology is the mythology of Celtic polytheism, apparently the religion of the Iron Age Celts. Like other Iron Age Europeans, the early Celts maintained a polytheistic mythology and religious structure. Among Celts in close contact with Ancient Rome, such as the Gauls and Celtiberians, their mythology did not survive the Roman empire, their subsequent conversion to Christianity, and the loss of their Celtic languages. It is mostly through contemporary Roman and Christian sources that their mythology has been preserved. The Celtic peoples who maintained either their political or linguistic identities (such as the Gaels, Picts, and Brythonic tribes of Great Britain and Ireland) left vestigial remnants of their forebears mythologies, put into written form during the Middle Ages. The gods and goddesses, or deities of the Celts are known from a variety of sources, including written Celtic mythology, ancient places of worship, statues, engravings, cult objects and place or personal names. The locus classicus for the Celtic gods of Gaul is the passage in Julius Caesars Commentarii de Bello Gallico in which he names six of them, together with their functions. He says that Mercury was the most honoured of all the gods and many images of him were to be found. Mercury was regarded as the inventor of all the arts, the patron of travellers and of merchants, and the most powerful god in matters of commerce and gain. After him the Gauls honoured Apollo, who drove away diseases, Mars, who controlled war, Jupiter, who ruled the heavens, and Minerva, who promoted handicrafts. He adds that the Gauls regarded Dis Pater as their ancestor. The gods named by Caesar are well-attested in the later epigraphic record of Gaul and Britain. Not infrequently, their names are coupled with native Celtic theonyms and epithets, such as Mercury Visucius, Lenus Mars, Jupiter Poeninus, or Sulis Minerva. Unsyncretised theonyms are also widespread, particularly among goddesses such as Sulevia, Sirona, Rosmerta, and Epona. In all, several hundred names containing a Celtic element are attested in Gaul. The majority occur only once, which has led some scholars to conclude that the Celtic gods and their cults were local and tribal rather than national. Supporters of this view cite Lucans mention of a god called Teutates, which they interpret as "god of the tribe" (it is thought that teuta- meant "tribe" in Celtic)The multiplicity of deity names may also be explained otherwise many, for example, may be simply epithets applied to major deities by widely extended cults.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Die keltische Mythologie beschreibt die Gesamtheit der &#252;berlieferungen des Volkes der Kelten, die sich mit Religion, Kulten und G&#246;tterverehrung befassen. W&#228;hrend von den im s&#252;dwestlichen Mitteleuropa ans&#228;ssigen Festlandkelten keine Texte in eigener Sprache erhalten sind, sondern lediglich die Berichte der r&#246;mischen Eroberer, Inschriften, Ortsnamen usw., existieren von den Inselkelten, die im heutigen Irland und Gro&#223;britannien siedelten, zahlreiche Zeugnisse einer Mythologie. &#220;berlieferungen zufolge hatten die Kelten etwa 400 G&#246;tter, 70 davon von gro&#223;er Bedeutung f&#252;r alle Kelten. H&#228;ufig sind Entsprechungen der keltischen Gottheiten mit griechischen oder r&#246;mischen festzustellen. So ist der Hauptgott Lug mit dem r&#246;mischen Merkur vergleichbar, Grannus mit Apollon, Taranis mit Jupiter, Esus und Teutates beide mit Merkur und Mars. Daneben gab es zahlreiche Muttergottheiten, die Matronen, die h&#228;ufig mit F&#252;llhorn und Fr&#252;chten dargestellt wurden. Auf eine der drei irischen Muttergottheiten, riu, geht der heutige Name Irlands, Eire, zur&#252;ck. Gottheiten wurden &#252;berwiegend in Zweier- und Dreiergruppen abgebildet. Neben G&#246;ttern wurden die Ahnen, aber auch Naturerscheinungen wie B&#228;ume, Fl&#252;sse, Berge und Tiere verehrt. Der Opferkult, der an heiligen St&#228;tten, h&#228;ufig um Menhire herumgebaute Tempel, stattfand, war verbreitet. Der Tod der Opfer machte Platz f&#252;r neues Leben. Nach dem Tod erwartete den Menschen der keltischen Mythologie zufolge im Jenseits ein Land der Gl&#252;ckseligkeit. Vier rituelle Feste der Kelten sind &#252;berliefert, die im Zusammenhang mit Jahreszeiten und Natur standen. H&#246;chste Instanzen in der keltischen Religion wie in der Gesellschaft insgesamt waren die Druiden. Sie vereinten in ihrer Person die Funktionen von Priester und Ausf&#252;hrendem beim Opferkult, von Richter und Gelehrtem (Medizin, Traumdeutung, Astronomie).</German>

		<Spanish>[TAB]La mitolog&#237;a celta es conocida por una serie de relatos de la aparente religi&#243;n de los celtas durante la edad de hierro. Al igual que otras culturas indoeuropeas durante este periodo, los primeros celtas mantuvieron una mitolog&#237;a polite&#237;sta y una estructura religiosa. Entre el pueblo celta en estrecho contacto con Roma, como los galos y los celt&#237;beros, esta mitolog&#237;a no sobrevivi&#243; al imperio romano, debido a su subsecuente conversi&#243;n al cristianismo y a la p&#233;rdida de sus idiomas originales, aunque ir&#243;nicamente fue a trav&#233;s de fuentes romanas y cristianas, contempor&#225;neas, que conocemos detalles sobre sus creencias.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En contraste, la comunidad celta que mantuvo sus identidades pol&#237;ticas o ling&#252;&#237;sticas (tales como las tribus de escotos y bretones de las Islas Brit&#225;nicas) transmiti&#243; por lo menos vestigios remanentes de las mitolog&#237;as de la edad de hierro, las cuales fueron registradas a menudo en forma escrita durante la Edad Media.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Debido a la escasez de fuentes sobrevivientes que pongan por escrito el idioma galo, se conjetura que los celtas paganos no eran extensamente alfabetizados, aunque una forma escrita de la lengua gala, utilizando el alfabeto griego, latino e it&#225;lico del Norte, fue usada (seg&#250;n lo evidenciado por los art&#237;culos votivos que llevan las inscripciones en lengua gala y el Calendario de Coligny). Julio C&#233;sar da testimonio del alfabetismo de los galos, pero tambi&#233;n describe que sus sacerdotes, los druidas, prohibieron utilizar la escritura para registrar ciertos versos de importancia religiosa, haciendo notar tambi&#233;n que los Helvecios ten&#237;an un censo escrito.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Roma introdujo el h&#225;bito m&#225;s extendido de inscripciones p&#250;blicas, y debilit&#243; el poder de los druidas en los territorios que conquist&#243;; de hecho, la mayor parte de las inscripciones sobre deidades descubiertas en Galia (Francia moderna), Britania y en otros lugares representan territorios celtas posteriores a la conquista romana.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La fuente cl&#225;sica sobre los dioses celtas de la Galia es la secci&#243;n "Commentarii de bello Gallico" de Julio C&#233;sar (52-51 ac; La Guerra de las Galias). En este, &#233;l nombra a los cinco dioses principales adorados en la Galia (seg&#250;n la pr&#225;ctica de su tiempo, &#233;l nombra a los dioses con el equivalente romano m&#225;s cercano) y describe sus roles. Mercurio era la m&#225;s venerada de todas las deidades y numerosas representaciones de &#233;l han sido descubiertas. Mercurio es visto como el creador de todas las artes (y a menudo es tomado para referirse a Lugus por esta raz&#243;n), protector de aventureros y comerciantes y el m&#225;s poderoso en relaci&#243;n al comercio y el beneficio. Adem&#225;s los galos reverenciaban a Apolo, Marte, J&#250;piter, y Minerva. Acerca de estas divinidades los celtas son descritos sosteniendo opiniones aproximadamente iguales a las de otros pueblos: Apolo disipa la enfermedad, Minerva anima habilidades, J&#250;piter gobierna los cielos, y Marte influye en la guerra. Adem&#225;s de estos cinco, &#233;l menciona que los Galos remontan su linaje a Dis Pater.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aunque tempranamente los escotos de Irlanda y partes del moderno Gales usaron la escritura Ogam para registrar inscripciones cortas (en gran parte nombres personales), el alfabetismo m&#225;s sofisticado no fue introducido a los territorios celtas que no hab&#237;an sido conquistados por Roma hasta el advenimiento del cristianismo; de hecho, muchos mitos ga&#233;licos primero fueron registrados por monjes cristianos, aunque sin la mayor parte de sus significados religiosos originales.</Spanish>

At the end of each day Ra was thought to die and sailed on his night voyage through the Underworld, leaving the Moon to light the world above. People believed that all of Egypt belonged to the gods, and that the Pharaoh was the representative on earth of the gods, or maybe a kind of god himself, and so everything in Egypt sort of belonged to the Pharaoh.

		<German>[TAB]Die antike polytheistische Religion des &#228;gyptischen Volkes bestand nach Herausbildung des pharaonischen Staates (Altes &#196;gypten) im 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. bis zu ihrer Verdr&#228;ngung durch das Christentum ca. im 4. Jahrhundert n. Chr. Die &#228;gyptische Religion war eine gewachsene Religion. Geoffenbarte, kanonische Schriften existierten nicht, stattdessen entstanden religi&#246;s heilige Texte wie Hymnen, Gebete oder Jenseitsschilderungen zu allen Zeiten neu. Die verehrten G&#246;tter repr&#228;sentierten alle einen bestimmten Lebens- und Erfahrungsbereich. Sie hatten vielfach Tiergestalt und waren durch bestimmte Schriftzeichen, Pflanzen oder die Sonnenscheibe gekennzeichnet. Neben lokalen Gottheiten wurden bedeutende G&#246;tter wie Amun, Re, Osiris oder Isis in ganz &#196;gypten verehrt. Eine Rangfolge der G&#246;tter gab es nicht. Jeder Gott stand im Mittelpunkt von mythischen Erz&#228;hlungen, die nicht nur seine Eigenschaften veranschaulichten, sondern zugleich Erkl&#228;rungen f&#252;r Welt- und Lebensprozesse wie Tod, Krankheit, Geburt, die Entstehung der Welt usw. boten. Durch Opfer, Gebet, Tempeldienst und Feste suchte man die G&#246;tter gn&#228;dig zu stimmen. Viele Gottheiten verehrte man besonders wegen ihrer Orakel, durch die sie den Gl&#228;ubigen Antworten auf ihre Lebensfragen erteilten. Im Zentrum der &#228;gyptischen Religion stand der Glaube an ein Weiterleben nach dem Tode. Osiris galt als Herrscher und Richter im Jenseits. Er befand &#252;ber den Aufstieg ins himmlische Lichtreich oder den Abstieg in die lichtlose Unterwelt. Die gewaltigen Grabanlagen der &#196;gypter (Pyramiden), die Mumifizierung ihrer Toten und ihre umfangreiche Totenliteratur bezeugen die Bedeutung des &#228;gyptischen Totenglaubens und die Intensit&#228;t ihrer Bem&#252;hungen um ein gl&#252;ckliches Fortleben in der N&#228;he Gottes. Der K&#246;nig (Pharao) wurde sowohl als sterblicher Mensch als auch als Beauftragter der Gottheit angesehen. Er hatte die von Gott gewollte Sch&#246;pfungsordnung zu bewahren, Tempel zu bauen und sein Volk zu einer gottgef&#228;lligen Lebensweise anzuleiten. Nur Pharao Echnaton (1351-1334 v. Chr.) proklamierte sich selbst als gottgleich, indem er allein den Glauben an den Sonnengott Aton zulie&#223;, als dessen einziger Mittler er fungierte. Echnatons religi&#246;se Reform hatte jedoch keinen Bestand, der traditionelle Polytheismus der &#196;gypter wurde nach seinem Tod wiederhergestellt. Im Zuge der Eroberung &#196;gyptens durch Alexander den Gro&#223;en (um 322 v. Chr.) und der Verst&#228;rkung des Einflusses der griechischen Kultur schwand die Bedeutung der &#228;gyptischen Gottheiten und Kulte. Einzelne G&#246;tter lebten jedoch in Mysterienkulten fort, z. B. Isis und Osiris.</German>

		<English>[TAB]Unlike the Greek gods, who were referred to before 1200 BC, Roman gods names can be found in inscrptures only as late as the sixth century BC. At this time, they were quite different to their Greek counterparts. It was in the late Republican era and during the Imperial age, that they were identified, so it appears like the Greek and Roman pantheon are the same, but with different names. Some Roman gods, though, do not have any Greek counterpart, such as Janus, Fortuna or the Lares. Roman gods werent originally married, nor did they have children. A family tree, as reported by Hesiod for the Greek gods, has been added later. Roman mythology is the body of traditional stories pertaining to ancient Romes legendary origins and religious system, as represented in the literature and visual arts of the Romans. The Romans usually treated their traditional narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. The stories are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individuals personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Heroism is an important theme. When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices, they are more concerned with ritual, augury, and institutions than with theology or cosmogony. The study of Roman religion and myth is complicated by the early influence of Greek religion on the Italian peninsula during Romes protohistory, and by the later artistic imitation of Greek literary models by Roman authors. The Romans were curiously eager to identify their own gods with those of the Greeks and reinterpret stories about Greek deities under the names of their Roman counterparts. Romes early myths and legends also have a dynamic relationship with Etruscan religion, less documented than that of the Greeks. While Roman mythology may lack a body of divine narratives as extensive as that found in Greek literature, Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf is as famous as any image from Greek mythology except for the Trojan Horse. Because Latin literature was more widely known in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, the interpretations of Greek myths by the Romans often had the greater influence on narrative and pictorial representations of "classical mythology" than Greek sources. In particular, the versions of Greek myths in Ovids Metamorphoses, written during the reign of Augustus, came to be regarded as canonical. Roman theology acknowledged that di immortales (immortal gods) ruled all realms of the heavens and earth. There were gods of the upper heavens, gods of the underworld and a myriad of lesser deities between. Some evidently favoured Rome because Rome honoured them, but none were intrinsically, irredeemably foreign or alien. The political, cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad, inclusive and flexible network of lawful cults. At different times and in different places, the spheres, characters and functions of divine beings could expand, overlap, and be redefined as Roman. Change was carefully embedded within existing traditions. Rome offered no native creation myth, and little mythography to explain the character of its deities, their mutual relationships or their interactions with the human worldrelationship. Several versions of a semi-official, structured pantheon were developed during the political, social and religious instability of the Late Republican era: all provided divine analogies to Roman political life and institutions. Jupiter, the most powerful of all gods and "the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested", consistently personified the divine authority of Romes highest offices, internal organization and external relations. During the archaic and early Republican eras, he shared his temple, some aspects of cult and several divine characteristics with Mars and Quirinus, who were later replaced by Juno and Minerva. These so called triads may have had some equivalence in the distinctively agricultural or plebeian triad of Ceres, Liber and Libera, and in some of the threefold, complementary deity-groupings of Imperial cult. Other major and minor deities could be single, coupled or linked retrospectively through myths of divine marriage and sexual adventure; later Roman pantheistic hierarchies are part literary and mythographic, part philosophical creations, and distinctively Greek. The Olympians supplied models for self-conscious Hellenisation and the mutual esteem of a shared antiquity. None of this seems to have had any significant effect on cult practice. On a daily basis, the impressive, costly and centralised rites to the deities of the Roman state were vastly outnumbered by commonplace cults to domestic and personal deities, the patron divinities of Romes non-elite communities and the often idiosyncratic blends of official, unofficial, local and personal cults that characterised lawful Roman religion.</English>

		<Spanish>[TAB]La mitolog&#237;a romana, es decir, las creencias mitol&#243;gicas de los habitantes de la Antigua Roma, puede considerarse formada por partes. La primera, principalmente tard&#237;a y literaria, consiste en pr&#233;stamos completamente nuevos procedentes de la mitolog&#237;a griega. La otra, mayoritariamente antigua y c&#250;ltica, funcionaba en formas muy diferentes a las de la equivalente griega.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los romanos no ten&#237;an relatos secuenciales sobre sus dioses comparables a la Titanomaquia o la seducci&#243;n de Zeus por Hera, hasta que sus poetas comenzaron a adoptar los modelos griegos en el &#250;ltimo lapso de tiempo de la rep&#250;blica romana. Sin embargo, lo que si ten&#237;an, era:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  Un sistema muy desarrollado de rituales, escuelas sacerdotales y panteones de dioses relacionados;[NEWLINE]  Un rico conjunto de mitos hist&#243;ricos sobre la fundaci&#243;n y auge de su ciudad por parte de actores humanos con ocasionales intervenciones divinas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El modelo romano inclu&#237;a una forma muy diferente a la de los griegos de definir y concebir a los dioses. Por ejemplo, en la mitolog&#237;a griega Dem&#233;ter era caracterizada por una historia muy conocida sobre su dolor por el rapto de su hija Pers&#233;fone a manos de Hades. Los antiguos romanos, por el contrario, conceb&#237;an a su equivalente Ceres como una deidad con un sacerdote oficial llamado Flamen, subalterno de los flamines de J&#250;piter, Marte y Quirino, pero superior a los de Flora y Pomona. Tambi&#233;n se le consideraba agrupado en una tr&#237;ada con otros dos dioses agr&#237;colas, Liber y Libera, y se sab&#237;a la relaci&#243;n de dioses menores con funciones especializadas que le asist&#237;an: Sarritor (escardado), Messor (cosecha), Convector (transporte), Conditor (almacenaje), Insitor (siembra) y varias docenas m&#225;s.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As&#237; pues, la mitolog&#237;a romana arcaica, al menos en lo referente a los dioses, no estaba formada por relatos sino m&#225;s bien el entrelazamiento y las complejas interrelaciones entre dioses y humanos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La religi&#243;n original de los primeros romanos fue modificada por la adici&#243;n de numerosas y contradictorias creencias en &#233;pocas posteriores, y por la asimilaci&#243;n de grandes porciones de la mitolog&#237;a griega. Lo poco que se sabe sobre la religi&#243;n romana primitiva no es gracias a relatos de la &#233;poca sino a escritores posteriores que buscaron preservar las viejas tradiciones del olvido en el que estaban cayendo, como el estudioso del siglo I a. C. Marco Terencio Varr&#243;n. Otros escritores cl&#225;sicos, como el poeta Ovidio en sus Fastos ('calendario'), fueron fuertemente influidos por los modelos helen&#237;sticos, y en sus obras se recurre con frecuencia a las creencias griegas para rellenar los huecos de las tradiciones romanas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En contraste con la escasez del material narrativo sobre los dioses, los romanos ten&#237;an una rica panoplia de leyendas sobre la fundaci&#243;n y primera expansi&#243;n de su propia ciudad. Adem&#225;s de estas tradiciones de origen mayoritariamente local, a este surtido se injert&#243; material procedente de las leyendas heroicas griegas en una &#233;poca temprana, haciendo por ejemplo a Eneas antepasado de R&#243;mulo y Remo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La Eneida y los primeros libros de Livio son las mejores fuentes exhaustivas para esta mitolog&#237;a humana.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The Norse or Scandinavian religion comprises the pre-Christian beliefs of the inhabitants of Scandinavia and Iceland. It is the best-known version of the pre-Christian Germanic religion, which was itself a subset of the ancient Indo-European religion that influenced belief systems from India to England. The Norse religion was not one that derived from the teachings of a single prophet or holy man; rather, it was a collection of very old beliefs passed down through oral tradition. There was no scripture to the religion, and very little formal organization to its practice. Even after the coming of Christianity, the Norse religion continued to hold a great deal of influence over traditional practices in many rural areas of Scandinavia. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Norse religion had a very unusual concept of the world. According to Norse mythology, the world consisted of a flat disc suspended on the branches of the world tree Yggdrasil. The gods lived in a realm called Asgard which was located at the center of this disc, and which could only be reached by walking on a rainbow bridge (called Bifrost). Humans inhabited a realm below Asgard called Midgard, and below our realm was Niflheim, the underground world of the dead. In addition to these places, there was also a land of giants called J&#246;tunheimr, the elfish home of &#193;lfheim, and the fiery land of Muspell, home to the fire giants. [PARAGRAPH:2]Supernatural deities in the Norse pantheon consisted of the Aesir and Vanir (two types of gods and goddesses), and the Jotuns, or giants. There were also a number of fantastic monsters and impossible creatures, such as huge serpents, giant wolves, and eight-legged horses. The Norse religion was dualistic. However, instead of being a dualism between good and evil (like Christianity, for instance), the split tended to be between order (represented by the gods) and chaos (symbolized by the giants and other monsters). [PARAGRAPH:2]Many of the Norse gods are well-known in contemporary culture. There were numerous legends about figures such as Thor, Odin, and Tyr, in addition to dozens of other deities. Human heroes were immortalized in Norse legends as well, such as Weyland, Siegfried, and Beowulf. According to Norse mythology, the world was created when Odin and his two brothers killed the sleeping giant Ymir and used his body to form the various realms described earlier. The world was also fated to be destroyed at the end of time in a great confrontation called Ragnarok, in which the forces of chaos would outnumber and kill the gods. The gods were aware of this, and gathered strong Viking warriors to fight at their side when the day of reckoning arrived, but nonetheless they were still doomed to failure. Odin would be eaten by the great Fenrir wolf, and Thor was fated to die facing the Midgard serpent. This was a surprisingly bleak future to look forward to, and perhaps explains why many of the Vikings were so desperate to claim glory and fame while they were alive. [PARAGRAPH:2]Norse religious ceremonies tended to take place in sacred groves, or at a simple altar of piled stones known as the "horgr." There were a few locations of special importance, however, such as the town of Uppsala where a temple was supposedly located. There are some records of occasional human sacrifice taking place, but these do not appear to have been common. [PARAGRAPH:2]The conflict between the Norse religion and Christianity was violent in some cases, and Sweden went through a civil war in the eleventh century over the issue. Eventually, Christianity won and the Norse faith slowly died out, with many traditions surviving for a long time in rural areas. While some individuals have initiated a revival of the Norse religion in recent decades, for the most part it remains a dead religion today. [PARAGRAPH:2]</English>
		<French>[TAB]La religion nordique (ou scandinave) englobe les croyances pr&#233;chr&#233;tiennes des peuples scandinaves et islandais. C'est la transposition la plus connue des cultes germaniques pa&#239;ens, eux-m&#234;mes issus de l'ancienne religion indo-europ&#233;enne, influence majeure de nombreux syst&#232;mes de croyance. La religion nordique ne s'appuie pas sur les enseignements d'un saint homme ou d'un proph&#232;te. Elle rel&#232;ve plut&#244;t d'un ensemble de tr&#232;s anciennes croyances transmise par la tradition orale. Il n'existe pas d'&#233;critures saintes, pas plus que de rites rigoureusement structur&#233;s. Bien apr&#232;s l'av&#232;nement du christianisme, la religion nordique a continu&#233; d'influencer les coutumes et le folklore de la Scandinavie rurale. [PARAGRAPH:2]La religion nordique poss&#232;de une conception cosmogonique originale. Selon elle, le monde est un disque plat suspendu aux branches du fr&#234;ne universel Yggdrasil. Les dieux vivent dans un royaume appel&#233; Asgard, situ&#233; au centre du disque. Un pont nomm&#233; Bifrost (Arc-en-ciel) permet de relier Asgard &#224; la terre des hommes. Les humains habitent le royaume de Midgard, juste en dessous d'Asgard,et sous leur monde se trouve Nifheim, s&#233;jour souterrain de la Mort. En dehors de ces lieux existent d'autres royaumes : Jotunheimr, la terre des G&#233;ants, Alfheim, le territoire des Elfes ou encore Muspel, l'ardente demeure des G&#233;ants de feu.[PARAGRAPH:2]Les divinit&#233;s et entit&#233;s surnaturelles principales du panth&#233;on nordique sont les Ases, les Vanes et les G&#233;ants. On y rencontre &#233;galement des &#234;tres mythiques et des cr&#233;atures fantastiques : serpents monstrueux, loups g&#233;ants, chevaux &#224; huit pattes. La religion nordique est dualiste. Cependant, plus qu'un dualisme manich&#233;en o&#249; s'affronteraient le Bien et le Mal, comme dans la religion chr&#233;tienne, par exemple, les forces qui s'opposent ici sont l'Ordre (repr&#233;sent&#233; par les Dieux) et le Chaos (symbolis&#233; par les G&#233;ants et autres monstres). [PARAGRAPH:2]Nombre de dieux de la mythologie nordique nous sont familiers. Diverses l&#233;gendes circulent, relatant les exploits de Thor, de Tyr ou d'Odin, pour ne mentionner que les plus c&#233;l&#232;bres parmi des douzaines d'autres. Les h&#233;ros mortels sont &#233;galement c&#233;l&#233;br&#233;s dans les l&#233;gendes nordiques. Ainsi en est-il pour Weyland, Siegfried ou encore Beowulf. Selon la mythologie nordique, le monde vit le jour lorsqu'Odin et ses deux fr&#232;res, tu&#232;rent Ymir le Serpent endormi et qu'ils utilis&#232;rent des parties de son corps pour former les royaumes d&#233;crits pr&#233;c&#233;demment. Le monde est destin&#233; &#224; dispara&#238;tre &#224; la fin des temps, dans une confrontation ultime appel&#233;e Ragnarok et dans laquelle les forces du Chaos surpasseront les dieux et les d&#233;truiront. Les dieux, avis&#233;s de leur sort, rassemblent autour d'eux les guerriers vikings les plus forts pour combattre &#224; leurs c&#244;t&#233;s le moment venu. Pr&#234;ts pour leur dernier combat, les dieux se savent pourtant condamn&#233;s. Odin sera d&#233;vor&#233; par le puissant loup Fenrir et Thor, quant &#224; lui, trouvera la mort en affrontant le serpent de Midgard. Cette vision t&#233;l&#233;ologique surprend par son aspect pessimiste, mais elle nous &#233;claire &#233;galement sur la mentalit&#233; des guerriers vikings, impatients de r&#233;clamer de leur vivant leur part de gloire et de c&#233;l&#233;brit&#233;. [PARAGRAPH:2]Les c&#233;r&#233;monies religieuses peuvent se d&#233;rouler en pleine nature, dans un bosquet sacr&#233;, par exemple, ou dans le cadre domestique sur un simple autel de pierres empil&#233;es appel&#233; "horgr". Cependant, il existait quelques emplacements sacr&#233;s, tels que la localit&#233; d' Uppsala en Su&#232;de o&#249; un temple magnifique &#233;tait para&#238;t-il &#233;rig&#233;. On rapporte quelques cas de sacrifices humains mais ceux-ci, semble-t-il, &#233;taient peu fr&#233;quents. [PARAGRAPH:2]La lutte entre les deux cultes concurrents, la religion nordique et la religion chr&#233;tienne, est &#226;pre, voire parfois violente comme en Su&#232;de au XIe si&#232;cle, o&#249; la question religieuse provoque une guerre civile. Au bout du compte, le christianisme sort vainqueur de la confrontation et la religion nordique s'&#233;teint lentement bien que subsistant en partie dans les coutumes et le folklore scandinaves. Aujourd'hui, quelques initi&#233;s essaient de faire revivre l'ancien culte nordique, mais son panth&#233;on appartient d&#233;sormais &#224; la m&#233;moire historique de l'humanit&#233;.[PARAGRAPH:2]</French>
		<German>[TAB]Die nordische Religion beschreibt die vorchristlichen Glaubensauffassungen der Einwohner von Skandinavien und Island. Hierbei handelt es sich um die bekannteste Version der vorchristlichen germanischen Religion, die ihrerseits selbst aus der antiken indo-europ&#228;ischen Religion hervorging, welche die Glaubenssysteme von Indien bis England beeinflusste. Sie basierte nicht auf den Lehren eines einzelnen Propheten oder Heiligen, sondern war vielmehr ein Sammelsurium aus sehr alten Glaubens&#252;berzeugungen, die durch m&#252;ndliche &#252;berlieferung weitergetragen wurden. Die Grunds&#228;tze dieser Religion waren nicht schriftlich fixiert und f&#252;r die zugeh&#246;rigen Praktiken gab es ebenfalls nur wenige formelle Vorgaben. Auch nach dem Aufkommen des Christentums hatte die nordische Religion nach wie vor gro&#223;en Einfluss auf die traditionellen Gebr&#228;uche in vielen l&#228;ndlichen Gegenden Skandinaviens. [PARAGRAPH:2]Die nordische Mythologie repr&#228;sentierte eine sehr ungew&#246;hnliche Weltanschauung. Danach war die Welt eine flache Scheibe, die von den Zweigen der Weltesche Yggdrasil gehalten wurde. Die G&#246;tter lebten in einem Reich namens Asgard, das sich im Zentrum dieser Scheibe befand und nur durch die &#252;berschreitung eines Regenbogens (als "Bifrost" bezeichnet) erreicht werden konnte. Die Menschen bewohnten ein unterhalb von Asgard gelegenes Reich namens Midgard und darunter befand sich wiederum das Reich Niflheim, die dunkle Welt der Toten. Abgesehen von diesen Orten gab es au&#223;erdem noch J&#246;ntunheim, das Land der Riesen, Alfheim, das Reich der Elfen, sowie Muspell, die Heimat der Feuerriesen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Zu den &#252;bernat&#252;rlichen Gottheiten der nordischen Ruhmeshalle geh&#246;rten die "Asen" und die "Wanen" (zwei verschiedene G&#246;ttergeschlechter) sowie die "J&#246;ntun", die Riesen. Au&#223;erdem waren in der nordischen Mythologie eine Reihe fantastischer Monster und Kreaturen vertreten, wie zum Beispiel Riesenschlangen, gigantische W&#246;lfe und achtbeinige Pferde. Grunds&#228;tzlich war die nordische Religion dualistisch orientiert. Allerdings beinhaltete dieser Dualismus nicht (wie zum Beispiel das Christentum) die Differenzierung zwischen Gut und B&#246;se, sondern eher eine Unterteilung nach Ordnung (durch die G&#246;tter repr&#228;sentiert) und Chaos (durch die Riesen und andere Monster symbolisiert). [PARAGRAPH:2]Viele der nordischen Gottheiten finden sich auch in der zeitgen&#246;ssischen Kultur wieder: Zahlreiche Legenden ranken sich um Thor, Odin, Tyr und Dutzende andere Gottheiten. Auch menschliche Helden wurden in den nordischen Legenden unsterblich gemacht, wie zum Beispiel Wieland, Siegfried und Beowulf. Nach der nordischen Mythologie wurde die Welt erschaffen, als Odin und seine beiden Br&#252;der den schlafenden Riesen Ymir t&#246;teten und aus seinen K&#246;rperteilen die vorgenannten Reiche schufen. Die Welt war dazu bestimmt, am Ende der Zeit durch einen gro&#223;en Kampf, die so genannte "Ragnar&#246;k" (Weltuntergang), zerst&#246;rt zu werden, w&#228;hrend dessen die Truppen des Chaos die G&#246;tter &#252;bertrumpfen und t&#246;ten w&#252;rden. Die G&#246;tter wussten darum und versammelten starke Wikingerkrieger um sich, damit sie am Tag der Abrechnung auf ihrer Seite k&#228;mpfen w&#252;rden, dennoch war ihr Untergang eindeutig vorherbestimmt: Odin w&#252;rde von dem gro&#223;en Fenriswolf gefressen und Thor erwartete das Schicksal, im Angesicht der Midgardschlange zu sterben. Diese &#252;berraschend d&#252;steren Zukunftsaussichten erkl&#228;ren vielleicht auch, warum viele Wikinger so verzweifelt versuchten, noch zu Lebzeiten Ruhm und Ehre zu erlangen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Die Zeremonien der nordischen Religion wurden im Allgemeinen an geweihten Hainen abgehalten oder an einem einfachen Altar, dem so genannten "H&#246;rgr", der aus aufgeh&#228;uften Steinen bestand. Dar&#252;ber hinaus gab es aber noch einige andere bedeutende religi&#246;se Pl&#228;tze, allen voran den Tempel von Uppsala in Schweden. Auch wenn manche Quellen auf gelegentlich dargebrachte Menschenopfer hindeuten, schienen sie dennoch nicht allgemein &#252;blich gewesen zu sein. [PARAGRAPH:2]Der Konflikt zwischen der nordischen Religion und dem Christentum wurde manchmal gewaltt&#228;tig ausgetragen und so brach in Schweden angesichts dieser Frage im 11. Jahrhundert ein B&#252;rgerkrieg aus. Schlie&#223;lich gewann das Christentum die Oberhand und der nordische Glaube rutschte langsam in die Bedeutungslosigkeit ab, wenngleich viele der dazugeh&#246;rigen Br&#228;uche noch lange in den l&#228;ndlichen Gegenden &#252;berdauerten. Trotz der Tatsache, dass die nordische Religion in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten vereinzelt wieder auflebte, bleibt sie dennoch bis heute eine eher vergessene Religion. [PARAGRAPH:2]</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Le credenze pre-cristiane degli abitanti della Scandinavia e dell'Islanda erano raccolte nella religione nordica (o scandinava). Si tratta della versione pi conosciuta della religione germanica precedente al cristianesimo, a sua volta derivante dalla religione indo-europea che influenz i sistemi religiosi dall'India all'Inghilterra. La religione nordica non deriva dagli insegnamenti di un singolo profeta o santo, ma la raccolta di una serie di antiche credenze tramandate oralmente. Non esisteva un libro sacro e per la sua professione non esistevano grossi apparati organizzativi formali. Anche dopo l'avvento del cristianesimo, essa continu ad avere una profonda influenza sulle pratiche tradizionali della Scandinavia rurale. [PARAGRAPH:2]La religione nordica aveva una concezione del mondo alquanto inusuale. Secondo la mitologia scandinava, il mondo era costituito da un disco piatto sospeso tra i rami dell'albero del mondo, Yggdrasil. Gli dei vivevano nel regno di Asgard, situato al centro di questo disco e raggiungibile soltanto camminando su un arcobaleno (chiamato Bifrost). Gli uomini risiedevano nel regno sottostante Asgard, Midgard, sotto il quale v'era un altro regno, quello di Niflheim, il regno sotterraneo dei morti. L'universo era completato dalla terra dei giganti (J&#246;tunheimr), dalla casa degli elfi (&#193;lfheim) e dall'infuocata terra di Muspell, patria dei giganti di fuoco. [PARAGRAPH:2]Le divinit soprannaturali del pantheon nordico erano gli Aesir e i Vanir (due tipi di dei e dee) e gli Jotun, o giganti. Si credeva anche all'esistenza di numerosi mostri e creature fantastiche come enormi serpenti, lupi giganti e cavalli a otto zampe. La religione nordica era dualistica, ma invece di esserci una lotta del bene contro il male (come nel cristianesimo), il contrasto era tra l'ordine (rappresentato dagli dei) e il caos (rappresentato dai giganti e dai mostri). [PARAGRAPH:2]Molte divinit nordiche sono abbastanza note nella cultura contemporanea. Molte leggende riguardavano Thor, Odino e Tyr, oltre a diverse decine di altre divinit. Anche gli eroi umani erano immortalati nelle leggende, come per esempio Weyland, Sigfrido e Beowulf. In base alla mitologia nordica, il mondo fu creato quando Odino e i suoi due fratelli uccisero il gigante Ymir e ne utilizzarono il corpo per creare i regni di cui sopra. Il mondo era destinato a essere distrutto alla fine dei tempi in un grande scontro, il Ragnarok, in cui le forze del caos avrebbero sconfitto gli dei grazie alla loro superiorit numerica. Gli dei, sapendolo, avrebbero riunito intorno a s&#233; forti guerrieri Vichinghi, ma ci nonostante sarebbero stati destinati al fallimento. Odino sarebbe stato divorato dal grande lupo Fenrir, mentre Thor sarebbe morto affrontando il serpente Midgard: un futuro alquanto deprimente, che forse spiega perch&#233; la maggior parte dei Vichinghi desiderasse la gloria e la fama finch&#233; era in vita. [PARAGRAPH:2]Le cerimonie religiose nordiche avvenivano in boschi sacri o presso semplici altari costituiti da pile di pietra e chiamati "horgr". C'erano tuttavia alcuni luoghi di speciale importanza, come la citt di Uppsala, dove presumibilmente si trovava un tempio. Si sa anche di alcuni sacrifici umani, ma sembra che non fossero comuni. [PARAGRAPH:2]Il conflitto tra la religione nordica e il cristianesimo in alcuni casi fu molto aspro e determin una guerra civile in Svezia nell'undicesimo secolo. Alla fine prevalse il cristianesimo e la fede nordica si perse, anche se le zone rurali mantennero a lungo molte tradizioni. Anche se negli ultimi decenni alcuni hanno cercato di far rifiorire la religione nordica, essa rimane per lo pi una religione morta. [PARAGRAPH:2]</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]La religi&#243;n normanda o escandinava est&#225; compuesta por las creencias precristianas de los habitantes de Escandinavia e Islandia. Es la versi&#243;n mejor conocida de la religi&#243;n germana precristiana, que a su vez era una derivaci&#243;n de la antigua indoeuropea que hab&#237;a influenciado todos los sistemas de creencias desde la India a Inglaterra. La religi&#243;n escandinava no derivaba de las ense&#241;anzas de un &#250;nico profeta o santo; por el contrario, era una colecci&#243;n de antiguas creencias transmitidas por tradici&#243;n oral. Carec&#237;a de escritos y, casi por completo, de organizaci&#243;n formal en sus pr&#225;cticas. Incluso tras la llegada del cristianismo, continu&#243; gozando de gran influencia en las prcticas tradicionales de muchas &#225;reas rurales de Escandinavia. [PARAGRAPH:2]Esta religi&#243;n ten&#237;a un concepto del mundo muy peculiar. Seg&#250;n la mitologa n&#243;rdica, el mundo era un disco plano suspendido sobre las ramas del gran &#225;rbol Yggdrasil. Los dioses viv&#237;an en un reino llamado Asgard, situado en el centro de este disco y al que solo pod&#237;a llegarse cruzando un puente de arco-iris (llamado Bifrost). Los humanos habitaban en un reino situado bajo Asgard y llamado Midgard, debajo del cual se encontraba Niflheim, el mundo subterr&#225;neo de los muertos. Adem&#225;s de estos lugares, exist&#237;a un reino de gigantes llamado J&#246;tunheimr, otro de elfos llamado lfheim y la ardiente tierra de Muspell, hogar de los gigantes del fuego. [PARAGRAPH:2]En el pante&#243;n n&#243;rdico, las criaturas sobrenaturales eran los aesires y vanires (dos tipos de dioses y diosas) y los jotunos o gigantes. Tambi&#233;n existan monstruos fant&#225;sticos y criaturas imposibles, como serpientes enormes, lobos gigantes y caballos de ocho patas. La religi&#243;n escandinava era dualista. Sin embargo, en lugar de un dualismo moral (como el del cristianismo), el suyo era una divisi&#243;n entre el orden (representado por los dioses) y el caos (simbolizado por los gigantes y otros monstruos). [PARAGRAPH:2]Muchos de sus dioses son bien conocidos en la cultura contempor&#225;nea. Hay numerosas leyendas sobre figuras como Thor, Od&#237;n, Tyr y muchas deidades m&#225;s. Las leyendas normandas tambi&#233;n est&#225;n repletas de h&#233;roes humanos, como Weyland, Sigfrido y Beowulf. Seg&#250;n la mitolog&#237;a escandinava, el mundo se cre&#243; cuando Od&#237;n y sus dos hermanos mataron al gigante durmiente Ymir y utilizaron su cuerpo para formar los diferentes reinos descritos antes. El mundo estaba condenado a ser destruido al final de los tiempos en una gran confrontaci&#243;n llamada Ragnarok, en la que las fuerzas del caos vencer&#237;an y matar&#237;an a los dioses. Los dioses, conscientes de ello, reun&#237;an a poderosos guerreros vikingos para que lucharan a su lado el d&#237;a indicado, pero a pesar de ello no pod&#237;an cambiar su destino. Od&#237;n ser&#237;a devorado por el gran lobo Fenrir y Thor morir&#237;a frente a la serpiente de Midgard. Se trata de una visi&#243;n muy pesimista del futuro y puede que explique por qu&#233; muchos de los vikingos estaban tan desesperados por obtener gloria y fama antes de morir. [PARAGRAPH:2]Las ceremonias religiosas ten&#237;an lugar en arboledas sagradas o en sencillos altares hechos de piedras conocidos como "horgr". Sin embargo, hab&#237;a algunos lugares especiales, como la ciudad de Uppsala, donde, seg&#250;n parece, se levantaba un gran templo. Hay algunos indicios de que se produjeron sacrificios humanos, pero parece ser que no eran habituales. [PARAGRAPH:2]El conflicto entre el cristianismo y la religi&#243;n n&#243;rdica fue violento en algunos casos, y Suecia sufri&#243; una guerra civil en el siglo XI por su causa. Finalmente, el cristianismo se llev&#243; la palma y la fe rival fue muriendo lentamente, aunque muchas de sus tradiciones sobrevivieron en el mundo rural durante largo tiempo. Aunque algunas personas han reanudado su prctica en los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os, en general puede considerarse una religi&#243;n desaparecida. [PARAGRAPH:2]</Spanish>

En cualquier caso, se apoder&#243; del trono por la violencia, y su advenimiento supuso una ruptura con el pasado, pues en ninguna de sus inscripciones se hace menci&#243;n de sus predecesores.

He made sweeping changes to the Assyrian government, considerably improving its efficiency and security. Assyrian forces became a standing army.

Later in his reign, Tiglath-Pileser III assumed total control of Babylonia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tiglath-Pileser III discouraged revolts against Assyrian rule, with the use of forced deportations of thousands of people all over the empire. He is considered to be one of the most successful military commanders in world history, conquering most of the world known to the Assyrians before his death.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Upon ascending the throne, Tiglath-Pileser instituted several reforms to different sectors of the Assyrian state, which arguably revived Assyria's hegemony over the Near East.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first of such reforms entailed thwarting the powers of the high Assyrian officials, which during the reigns of his predecessors had become excessive. Officials such as Samsi-ilu, who was turtanu and a prominent official since the time of Adad-Nirari III, often led their own campaigns and erected their own commemorative stelae, often without mentioning the king at all. Since his earliest inscriptions (and thus from the beginning of his reign), he gave regular mention of appointing eunuchs as governors of (newly conquered) provinces; this removed the threat of provincial rule becoming a dynastic matter. He also sought to reduce the power of his officials by reducing the size of the provinces (in some cases the northern provinces were increased to include newly conquered territories), thus decreasing their resources, should they have desired to incite a revolt. Subsequently, there were more provinces, more governors (most of which were eunuchs), and less power per governor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The second reform targeted the army. Instead of a largely native Assyrian army which normally campaigned only in the summer time, Tiglath-Pileser incorporated large numbers of conquered people into the army, thus adding a substantial foreign element. This force mainly comprised the infantry, whereas the native Assyrians comprised the cavalry and chariotry. As a result of Tiglath-Pileser's military reforms, the Assyrian Empire was armed with a greatly expanded army which could campaign throughout the year. The addition of the cavalry and the chariot contingents to the army was mostly due to the steppe cultures lurking nearby to the north, which sometimes invaded their northern lands, using mainly cavalry and primitive chariots.</English>

Como resultado de esta guerra de Babilonia, Ant&#237;gono perdi&#243; casi dos terceras partes de su imperio: todas las satrap&#237;as del este pasaron a poder de Seleuco.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despu&#233;s de varias campa&#241;as contra Ptolomeo en las costas de Cilicia y Chipre, Demetrio parti&#243; con una flota de 250 barcos a Atenas, liberando la ciudad en 307 a. C. de la tiran&#237;a de Casandro de Macedonia, expulsando a la guarnici&#243;n que estaba destinada all&#237; al mando de Demetrio de Falero, y sitiando y tomando Muniquia. Despu&#233;s de estas victorias, tanto &#233;l como su padre fueron adorados por los atenienses como divinidades tutelares bajo el t&#237;tulo de Soter (Griego: &#963;&#969;&#964;&#942;&#961;, "salvador" o "benefactor por encima de otros benefactores"), como theoi soteres.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En 306 a. C. obtuvo una important&#237;sima victoria naval sobre la Armada egipcia, comandada por Menelao, hermano de Ptolomeo, en Salamina de Chipre, destruyendo completamente su flota. Presuntamente, la Victoria de Samotracia conmemorar&#237;a este &#233;xito naval.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el mismo a&#241;o, Demetrio conquist&#243; Chipre, capturando a uno de los hijos de Ptolomeo.1 Despu&#233;s de la victoria, Ant&#237;gono asumi&#243; el t&#237;tulo de rey y se lo otorg&#243; tambi&#233;n a su hijo Demetrio. En 305 a. C., ya con el t&#237;tulo de rey, Demetrio trat&#243; de castigar a los rodios, firmes aliados de Egipto. Su ingenio en el dise&#241;o de nuevas armas de asedio en su fallido intento de reducir la capital le gan&#243; el t&#237;tulo de Poliorcetes. Entre sus creaciones se encontraba un ariete de 55 m de longitud, que requer&#237;a 1.000 hombres para manejarlo, y una torre de asedio con ruedas, llamada "helepolis" (o "tomadora de ciudades") de unos 45 m de altura y 18 m de ancho, que necesitaba 3.400 hombres para su desplazamiento.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Intervino nuevamente en Grecia a partir de 304 a.

C. y de su hijo Filipo IV abri&#243; una disputa sucesoria entre los pretendientes Alejandro V y Ant&#237;patro II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Proclamado rey de Macedonia como Demetrio I en 294 a. C., mantiene guerras con Lis&#237;maco y su aliado Pirro de Epiro. En 291 a. C., se casa en la isla de Corcira con Lanassa, la antigua esposa despechada de Pirro, con er&#243;tico resultado. Pero las fuerzas combinadas de Pirro, Lis&#237;maco y Ptolomeo consiguen expulsarle de Macedonia en 288 a. C.3[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pas&#243; a Asia y atac&#243; a Lis&#237;maco con &#233;xito variable. El hambre y la peste destruyeron la mayor parte de su ej&#233;rcito, por lo que solicit&#243; el apoyo de Seleuco, rey de Babilonia y Siria. Pero antes de llegar a Siria estallaron las hostilidades entre los dos, y despu&#233;s de haber obtenido algunas ventajas sobre su yerno, Demetrio fue abandonado totalmente por sus tropas y se debi&#243; rendir a Seleuco.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Su hijo Ant&#237;gono ofreci&#243; todos sus bienes, e incluso su propia persona, para conseguir su libertad. Pero todo result&#243; in&#250;til, y Demetrio, dado a la bebida y los excesos, muri&#243; despu&#233;s de una reclusi&#243;n de tres a&#241;os (283 a. C.). Sus restos fueron entregados a Ant&#237;gono y honrado con un gran funeral en Corinto.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sus descendientes continuaron en el trono de Macedonia hasta la &#233;poca de Perseo, cuando Macedonia fue conquistada por los romanos en el 168 a.

Desde el primer momento llev&#243; a cabo una pol&#237;tica muy personal, extendiendo su influencia sobre la Cirenaica, los oasis libios y Chipre.

		<Spanish>[H1]Jerjes[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Jerjes I, tambi&#233;n conocido como Jerjes el Grande) (circa 519-465 a. C.), fue el quinto Gran Rey del Imperio aquem&#233;nida (485-465 a.

Su nombre Jerjes (tambi&#233;n escrito Xerxes) es una transliteraci&#243;n al griego ("Xerx&#275;s") de su nombre persa tras su ascensi&#243;n al trono, Jsh&#257;y&#257;r sh&#257;h, que significa "gobernador de h&#233;roes". En la Biblia se le menciona como "Asuero" (Axashverosh o Ahasuerus transliterado al griego).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Jerjes fue designado como sucesor de Dar&#237;o I por delante de todos sus hermanastros, mayores que &#233;l, y que nacieron antes de que Dar&#237;o ascendiera al trono. Tras ser coronado en octubre de 485 a. C., Jerjes se enfrent&#243; victoriosamente a una rebeli&#243;n en el Egipto sometido, iniciada en 486 a. C., dejando a su hermano Aquemenes como s&#225;trapa de &#233;ste, sobre el cual ejerci&#243; un control muy represivo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Trat&#243; de vengar la derrota sufrida por su padre, Dar&#237;o I, en la batalla de Marat&#243;n, durante la Primera Guerra M&#233;dica (490 a.

Dar&#237;o no hab&#237;a podido castigar a los atenienses por su intromisi&#243;n en la Revuelta j&#243;nica en Asia Menor, por lo que Jerjes planific&#243; la operaci&#243;n de castigo con sumo cuidado (483 a. C.). De esta forma, mand&#243; excavar un canal a trav&#233;s del istmo que comunicaba la pen&#237;nsula de Monte Athos con el continente europeo; se almacenaron provisiones en escalas a lo largo de la ruta que recorr&#237;a Tracia; y se erigieron dos puentes que atravesaban el Helesponto. Jerjes concluy&#243; una alianza con Cartago, lo cual priv&#243; a los griegos hel&#233;nicos del apoyo de los griegos sicilianos de Agrigento y Siracusa, a la vez que consigui&#243; ganar para la causa persa a varios estados griegos, como Tesalia, Macedonia, Tebas y Argos. Los persas lograron reunir para la ocasi&#243;n una gran flota (la mayor&#237;a de las naves proced&#237;an de sus vasallos fenicios y chipriotas) y un poderoso ej&#233;rcito.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]De esta forma, en la primavera del a&#241;o 480 a. C., Jerjes abandon&#243; Sardes al frente de su ej&#233;rcito, desencadenando as&#237; la Segunda Guerra M&#233;dica contra la alianza griega de Atenas y Esparta. En principio el ej&#233;rcito persa consigui&#243; importantes victorias: la flota griega fue rechazada en el cabo Artemisio, y tras la victoria sobre Le&#243;nidas I de Esparta y sus 300 hombres en el desfiladero de las Term&#243;pilas, los persas devastaron Beocia y el &#193;tica, llegando hasta Atenas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La batalla naval librada en Salamina (480 a.

Perdida la comunicaci&#243;n por mar con Asia Menor, Jerjes decidi&#243; retornar a Sardes; el ej&#233;rcito que dej&#243; en Grecia al mando de Mardonio fue derrotado en 479 a. C. en Platea. La posterior derrota persa en M&#237;cala, al norte de Mileto, supuso la libertad de las ciudades griegas de Asia Menor y la renuncia de Jerjes a las mismas, dejando de entrometerse en la pol&#237;tica griega.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dej&#243; varias inscripciones: en Van (Armenia), en el Monte Elvend (cerca de Ecbatana), y en Pers&#233;polis, donde mand&#243; a&#241;adir un nuevo y suntuoso palacio a aqu&#233;l que dejara su padre Dar&#237;o. En todos esos textos simplemente recogi&#243; las palabras de su padre. El 4 de agosto de 465 a.

		<English>[H1]Dido[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Dido was, according to ancient Greek and Roman sources, the founder and first Queen of Carthage (in modern-day Tunisia). She is best known from the account given by the Roman poet Virgil in his Aeneid. In some sources she is also known as Elissa. Eventually Elissa and her followers arrived on the coast of North Africa where Elissa asked the local inhabitants for a small bit of land for a temporary refuge until she could continue her journeying, only as much land as could be encompassed by an oxhide. They agreed. Elissa cut the oxhide into fine strips so that she had enough to encircle an entire nearby hill, which was therefore afterwards named Byrsa "hide". (This event is commemorated in modern mathematics: The "isoperimetric problem" of enclosing the maximum area within a fixed boundary is often called the "Dido Problem" in modern Calculus of variations.) That would become their new home. Many of the locals joined the settlement and both locals and envoys from the nearby Phoenician city of Utica urged the building of a city. In digging the foundations an oxs head was found, indicating a city that would be wealthy but subject to others. Accordingly another area of the hill was dug instead where a horses head was found, indicating that the city would be powerful in war. But when the new city of Carthage had been established and become prosperous, Iarbas, a native king of the Maxitani or Mauritani (manuscripts differ), demanded Elissa for his wife or he would make war on Carthage. Elissas envoys, fearing Iarbas, told Elissa only that Iarbas terms for peace were that someone from Carthage must dwell permanently with him to teach Phoenician ways and they added that of course no Carthaginian would agree to dwell with such savages. Elissa condemned any who would feel that way when they should indeed give their lives for the city if necessary. Elissas envoys then explained that Iarbas had specifically requested Elissa as wife. Elissa was trapped by her words. But Elissa preferred to stay faithful to her first husband and after creating a ceremonial funeral pyre and sacrificing many victims to his spirit in pretense that this was a final honoring of her first husband in preparation for marriage to Iarbas, Elissa ascended the pyre, announced that she would go to her husband as they desired, and then slew herself with her sword. After this self-sacrifice Elissa was deified and was worshipped as long as Carthage endured. In this account, the foundation of Carthage occurred 72 years before the foundation of Rome. Virgils back-references in his Aeneid generally agree with what Justins epitome of Trogus recorded. Dido and Aeneas fall in love by the management of Juno and Venus, acting in concert though for different reasons. When the rumour of the love affair comes to King Iarbas the Gaetulian, "a son of Jupiter Ammon by a raped Garamantian nymph", Iarbas prays to his father, blaming Dido who has scorned marriage with him yet now takes Aeneas into the country as her lord. Jupiter dispatches Mercury to send Aeneas on his way and the pious Aeneas sadly obeys. Mercury tells Aeneas of all the promising Italian lands and orders Aeneas to get his fleet ready. Dido can no longer bear to live. Dido has her sister Anna build her a pyre under the pretence of burning all that reminded her of Aeneas, including weapons and clothes that Aeneas had left behind and (what she calls) their bridal bed (though, according to Aeneas, they were never officially married.) When Dido sees Aeneas fleet leaving she curses him and his Trojans and proclaims endless hate between Carthage and the descendants of Troy, foreshadowing the Punic Wars. Dido ascends the pyre, lies again on the couch which she had shared with Aeneas, and then falls on a sword that Aeneas had given her. Those watching let out a cry; Anna rushes in and embraces her dying sister; Juno sends Iris from heaven to release Didos spirit from her body. From their ships, Aeneas and his crew see the glow of Didos burning funeral pyre and can only guess what has happened.

		<German>[H1]Dido[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Dido (auch Elissa oder Elyssa) war der Gr&#252;ndungslegende Karthagos nach eine ph&#246;nizische Prinzessin. Der Historiker Junianus Justinus nennt die Gr&#252;ndung Karthagos in Verbindung mit "Elissa" (Dido bei den R&#246;mern). Elissa soll die tyrische Tochter des K&#246;nigs Mutto gewesen sein. Aufgrund ihrer Verfolgung durch ihren Bruder Pygmalion gelangte sie &#252;ber Zypern an den Golf von Tunis. Der ortsans&#228;ssige H&#228;uptling versprach ihr so viel Land, wie sie mit einer Kuhhaut umspannen k&#246;nne. Dido schnitt daraufhin die Kuhhaut in d&#252;nne Streifen, legte sie aneinander und konnte somit ein gro&#223;es St&#252;ck Land markieren. Dieser K&#252;stenstreifen bildete die Byrsa, die Keimzelle Karthagos. Nach der Gr&#252;ndung Karthagos habe sich Elissa selbst auf einem Scheiterhaufen geopfert, um der Stadt Wohlstand zu garantieren. Au&#223;erdem ist der Name der Dido mit Aeneas verkn&#252;pft. Allerdings wurde diese Version erst 1000 Jahre nach Didos Tod in Vergils Aeneis ver&#246;ffentlicht. Was nun folgt ist eine kurze Inhaltsangabe der von Vergil geschilderten Geschehnisse: Auf der Flucht aus Troja treibt den Aeneas ein Sturm an die K&#252;ste des neu gegr&#252;ndeten Karthago, dessen K&#246;nigin Dido ihn gastlich aufnimmt. Auf Betreiben von Venus, der Mutter von Aeneas, die ihren Sohn auf diese Weise sch&#252;tzen will, und Iuno, die ihn so vom verhei&#223;enen Land Italien fernhalten will, verliebt sich Dido unsterblich in Aeneas. Trotz eines Eides, den sie einst abgelegt hatte, sich nie mehr mit einem Mann einzulassen, vereinigt sie sich mit Aeneas w&#228;hrend eines Unwetters in einer H&#246;hle. Doch Iuppiter schickt den G&#246;tterboten Merkur, um Aeneas an seine Pflichten zu erinnern - so verl&#228;sst er Karthago, was Dido in den Selbstmord treibt: Sie ersticht sich mit dem Schwert des Aeneas. Doch zuvor schw&#246;rt sie Rache und schafft so die Grundlage f&#252;r den sp&#228;teren Konflikt zwischen Rom und Karthago. Die literarische Vollendung erfuhr diese Geschichte durch Vergils Aeneis - den Gr&#252;ndungsmythos des R&#246;mischen Reichs. &#196;lteren &#220;berlieferungen zufolge hatte Dido allerdings andere Gr&#252;nde, Selbstmord zu begehen: Iarbas, der sah, dass Dido eine erfolgreiche Stadt aufbaute, wollte diese nun dazu zwingen, ihn zu heiraten. Von ihrem eigenen Volk dazu gedr&#228;ngt, sah sie sich gezwungen, Selbstmord zu begehen, um ihrem verstorbenen Ehemann treu bleiben zu k&#246;nnen.</German>

		<Spanish>[H1]Dido[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]En fuentes griegas y romanas, Dido o Elisa de Tiro aparece como la fundadora y primera reina de Cartago, en el actual T&#250;nez. Su fama se debe principalmente al relato incluido en la Eneida del poeta romano Virgilio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Era hija del rey de Tiro, Belo, tambi&#233;n conocido como Muto.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dido ten&#237;a dos hermanos: Pigmali&#243;n, que hered&#243; el trono de Tiro, y la peque&#241;a Ana.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Siqueo o Sicarbas, sacerdote del templo de Melkart en Tiro (divinidad relacionada con H&#233;rcules), pose&#237;a vastos tesoros escondidos. Pigmali&#243;n los codiciaba, y para saber su paradero oblig&#243; a su hermana Elisa a casarse con Siqueo sin revelarle el inter&#233;s oculto en ese matrimonio. Elisa no amaba a Siqueo, aunque &#233;ste a ella s&#237;. Un tiempo despu&#233;s, Pigmali&#243;n le coment&#243; a su hermana que ser&#237;a conveniente saber d&#243;nde se escond&#237;an las riquezas de Siqueo. Entendiendo que hab&#237;a sido utilizada, Elisa averigu&#243; d&#243;nde estaban escondidas pero sin contar la verdad a su hermano. Los tesoros se hab&#237;an enterrado en el jard&#237;n del templo, y Elisa le dijo a Pigmali&#243;n que se hallaban ocultos debajo del altar. Esa misma noche, Pigmali&#243;n envi&#243; unos sicarios a matar a Siqueo. Tras llevarlo a cabo, los esbirros cavaron in&#250;tilmente una fosa bajo el altar. Elisa encontr&#243; a su marido asesinado y corri&#243; a desenterrar el tesoro del jard&#237;n. Con &#233;l en su poder, huy&#243; de Tiro llev&#225;ndose a su hermana Ana y un s&#233;quito de doncellas, ayudada por amigos de Siqueo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Elisa lleg&#243; a las costas de &#193;frica, donde viv&#237;an los g&#233;tulos o getulos, una tribu de libios cuyo rey era Jarbas. Pidi&#243; hospitalidad y un trozo de tierra para instalarse en ella con su s&#233;quito. Jarbas le expuso que le dar&#237;a tanta tierra como ella pudiera abarcar con una piel de buey. Elisa, a fin de que la piel abarcara la m&#225;xima tierra posible, la hizo cortar finas tiras y as&#237; consigui&#243; circunscribir un extenso per&#237;metro. Tras esto hizo erigir una fortaleza llamada Birsa, que m&#225;s tarde se convirti&#243; en la ciudad de Cartago o Qart-Hadash (que en fenicio significaba "Ciudad Nueva"), sobre un promontorio existente entre el lago de T&#250;nez y la laguna Sebkah er-Riana, que desembocaba en mar abierto. Instaurada como soberana de la ciudadela, recibi&#243; de los ind&#237;genas el nombre de Dido.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hay dos versiones acerca de la muerte de Dido.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la versi&#243;n cl&#225;sica, Jarbas quiere desposarla, pero Dido es todav&#237;a fiel al recuerdo del difunto Siqueo. Creyendo que si rechazaba a Jarbas &#233;ste tomar&#237;a represalias contra ella y su gente, acepta, pero el d&#237;a de la boda, antes de celebrarla, Dido se hunde un pu&#241;al en el pecho. &#201;ste ser&#237;a el modelo de los sacrificios que los cartagineses ofrecer&#237;an en el tofet. Por esto la muerte de Dido se relaciona con la figura mitol&#243;gica del F&#233;nix, que muere en el fuego para renacer de sus cenizas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La segunda versi&#243;n es la que aparece en la Eneida de Virgilio. Eneas llega a la costa de Cartago, Dido se enamora de &#233;l en seguida y Eneas la corresponde. Pasan un tiempo juntos, pero Eneas, que ha recibido de J&#250;piter la misi&#243;n de fundar un nuevo pueblo en el Lacio, debe partir hacia su destino. Una noche, Eneas embarca con su gente y Dido corre a convencerle de que permanezca a su lado, mas en vano. Le ve partir y ordena levantar una gigantesca pira, donde se disponen la espada del h&#233;roe, algunas ropas suyas que hab&#237;an quedado en palacio y el tronco del &#225;rbol que custodiaba la entrada de la cueva donde se amaron por primera vez. Al amanecer subi&#243; a la pira y se hundi&#243; en el pecho la espada de Eneas. Tras su muerte, su hermana Ana, que hab&#237;a intentado disuadirla del suicidio, ordena a su vez prender la pira funeraria. Acerca de esta segunda versi&#243;n, el poeta Ovidio dedic&#243; una ep&#237;stola en sus c&#233;lebres Heroidas, la VII (carta de Dido a Eneas), donde la fundadora de Cartago manifiesta su intenci&#243;n de suicidarse ante la partida y traici&#243;n de Eneas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tras su muerte fue venerada como una divinidad.</Spanish>

C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Siendo el menor de los hijos de Shubiluliuma, parece que se tuvo que conformar con un puesto de jefe de la guardia real, al copar sus hermanos los grandes cargos hititas de la &#233;poca. Sin embargo, al ser asesinado su hermano Zannanza en un viaje a Egipto, y fallecer, posteriormente, tanto Shubiluliuma I como Arunanda II v&#237;ctimas de una peste tra&#237;da por captivos egipcios, se convirti&#243; en rey, con el apoyo de sus hermanos Sarri-Kusuh y Telebino, virreyes de Carkemish y Alepo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La ascensi&#243;n al trono de un rey tan joven y tan poco experimentado provoc&#243; reacciones hostiles entre los kaskas, que ya hab&#237;an iniciado una invasi&#243;n en tiempos de Arnuanda II, los reinos vasallos de Siria y los reinos de Arzawa en Anatolia occidental.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los kaskas eran, probablemente, la amenaza m&#225;s peligrosa, por su cercan&#237;a a la capital, Hattusa, por lo que Mursil se volvi&#243; primero contra estos, y, al cabo de dos a&#241;os, logr&#243; rechazarlos. Con los kaskas temporalmente calmados, se volvi&#243; contra Arzawa, castigando a los instigadores de la coalici&#243;n anti-hitita, los reinos de Arzawa menor y del pa&#237;s del Rio Seha. Tras estas campa&#241;as en el oeste, Mursil tuvo que volver al norte, ya que los kaskas ten&#237;an un nuevo caudillo, Pihhuniya, de considerable habilidad pol&#237;tica. Mursil logr&#243; derrotar a Pihhuniya y capturar algunos territorios al nordeste de Hattusa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Calmado el norte y el oeste del pa&#237;s, Mursil, en el s&#233;ptimo a&#241;o de su reinado, pudo prestar toda la atenci&#243;n necesaria a los levantamientos en Siria, donde, con la ayuda de sus hermanos, los virreyes de Carkemish y Aleppo, Mursil logr&#243; sofocar a los vasallos que no se hab&#237;an mostrado leales y derrotar a una expedici&#243;n egipcia en apoyo de los rebeldes. No obstante, la muerte del virrey de Carkemish, Sarri-Kusuh, poco tiempo despu&#233;s, provoc&#243; m&#225;s revueltas e incluso una invasi&#243;n asiria, obligando a Mursil de nuevo a someter a todos los vasallos y expulsar a los asirios de Carkemish.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tras lograr por fin la paz en Siria, Mursil hubo de enfrentarse a los frutos de haber dedicado su atenci&#243;n a la zona oriental del reino: m&#225;s rebeliones en Arzawa, que sofoc&#243; con efectividad, hasta el punto de que probablemente someti&#243; a todos los reinos de Arzawa, y nuevas invasiones kaskas, que tambi&#233;n pudo repeler, aunque a un coste mayor. Para evitar nuevas rebeliones y repoblar el n&#250;cleo del imperio hitita, gravemente afectado por la enfermedad que comenz&#243; con su padre Shubiluliuma, Mursil instaur&#243; la pr&#225;ctica del traslado forzoso de poblaci&#243;n, que se convirti&#243; en una pr&#225;ctica habitual de sus sucesores.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mursil destac&#243; entre los reyes hititas por su religiosidad -cre&#237;a que la epidemia que asol&#243; el imperio hitita, era un castigo de los dioses por el asesinato de su t&#237;o Tudhalia III a manos de su padre, Shubiluliuma-, y pidi&#243; perd&#243;n en numerosas ocasiones por ello.

Adem&#225;s, en el d&#233;cimo a&#241;o de su gobierno, hubo un eclipse solar (1312 a.

They showed an affinity for decoration with heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The Illyrians alternately allied with Romans and Macedons, and despite they were conquered by the Romans, eventually, they distinguished themselves as warriors in the Roman legions and made up a significant portion of the Praetorian Guard.

		<German>[H1]Die Thebaner[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Theben liegt auf den Vorh&#246;hen des Teumessos und wurde schon von Homer als die Stadt der sieben Tore bezeichnet. Die mythische Geschichte des b&#246;otischen Thebens ist reich an Legenden um Herakles, Dionysos und Laios. Die Stadt ist Zentrum des thebanischen Sagenkreises und Geburtsstadt des Herakles, der Niobe, des &#214;dipus, der Sieben gegen Theben und Antigones. Das antike b&#246;otische Theben lag in quellenreicher, h&#252;geliger Gegend &#252;ber dem s&#252;dlichen Rande der aonischen Ebene. Als fr&#252;he Bewohner gelten die Kadmeer (Kadmeionen). Die Stadt oder zun&#228;chst die Burg Kadmeia wurde der Sage nach von dem Ph&#246;nizier Kadmos gegr&#252;ndet, nachdem er den Drachen get&#246;tet hatte, der das Land ver&#246;dete. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]507 v.Chr. begann Theben einen Krieg gegen Athen, wurde aber besiegt. In den Perserkriegen stand Theben auf der Seite des Perserreichs und erlitt mit diesen die Niederlage bei Plat&#228;&#228; 479 v.Chr., worauf die H&#228;upter der persischen Partei hingerichtet wurden. Thebens Ansehen hatte infolgedessen so gelitten, dass Athen in den b&#246;otischen St&#228;dten, die sonst von Theben beherrscht wurden, demokratische Verfassungen installieren konnte. Thebens Einfluss war nach der Niederlage bei Oinophyta 456 v.Chr. so sehr gesunken, dass alle St&#228;dte des B&#246;otischen Bundes ausser Theben selbst nun Teil des von Athen kontrollierten Attischen Bundes waren. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Im Peloponnesischen Krieg geh&#246;rte Theben zu den erbittertesten Feinden Athens und versuchte 431 v.Chr. vergeblich, Plat&#228;&#228; zu erobern. Erst 427 v.Chr. gelang mit Unterst&#252;tzung von Sparta die Zerst&#246;rung dieser Stadt. 410 v.Chr. erneuerte Theben seinen Bund mit Sparta. Als nach dem Sturz der Demokratie in Athen dort die 30 Tyrannen herrschten, sammelten sich vor allem in Theben die athenischen Fl&#252;chtlinge und besetzten von hier aus 403 v.Chr. unter Thrasybulos die kleine Grenzfeste Phyle und sp&#228;ter den Athener Seehafen Pir&#228;us. In dieser Phase nahm Theben wieder eine demokratische Verfassung an. Nachdem Sparta Athen als m&#228;chtigste griechische Stadt abgel&#246;st hatte, stand Theben nun nicht mehr auf der spartanischen Seite. Auch begann es 395 v. Chr. Im Bund mit Korinth und Argos f&#252;hrten sie einen wenig erfolgreichen Krieg gegen Sparta. Der Krieg zog sich bis 386 hin und endete in einem vom persischen Grok&#246;nig gestifteten Frieden. Beim Ausbruch eines erneuten Krieges mit Sparta besetzte der spartanische Feldherr Phoibidas durch einen Handstreich mit Hilfe von Leontiadas die Burg von Theben, stellte die Herrschaft der Aristokratie wieder her und schickte die H&#228;upter der demokratischen Partei in die Verbannung. Aber schon 379 v.Chr. kehrte Pelopidas mit den &#252;brigen Fl&#252;chtlingen nach Theben zur&#252;ck, st&#252;rzte die Aristokraten und erzwang mit Hilfe eines athenischen Heers die R&#228;umung der Thebaner Burg. Theben schloss hierauf ein B&#252;ndnis mit Athen. Als die Thebaner 371 v.Chr. sich von den Spartanern nicht die Aufl&#246;sung des B&#246;otischen Bundes aufzwingen liessen, nahm die Auseinandersetzung mit Sparta eine neue Wendung. Zwei besonders f&#228;hige Gener&#228;le, Pelopidas und Epameinondas schafften das Unm&#246;gliche und schlugen zum ersten Mal &#252;berhaupt die Spartiaten in einer offenen Feldschlacht. Mit der Schlacht von Leuktra endete nicht nur der Krieg, sondern nun war Theben zum ersten Mal der m&#228;chtigste Stadtstaat in Griechenlamd. Theben st&#252;rzte sogar Spartas Macht auf dem Peloponnes, indem Epameinondas den Arkadischen Bund stiftete und die Unabh&#228;ngigkeit Messeniens wiederherstellte. Man strebte sogar nach einer Seeherrschaft, um Athen aus dieser Machtposition zu verdr&#228;ngen. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Der Aufstieg Makedoniens hatte besonders f&#252;r Theben &#252;ble Folgen. Auf die falsche Nachricht von dessen Tod rebellierte Theben 335 v.Chr. gegen Alexander den Groen. Schon nach zw&#246;lf Tagen stand dieser vor der Stadt und zerst&#246;rte sie nach dem Beschluss des korinthischen Synedrions; 6.000 Thebaner fielen, 30.000 wurden als Sklaven verkauft. Alexander liess nur das Haus des Dichters Pindar stehen. Erst 313 v.Chr. wurde Theben von Kassandros befreit und 315 v.Chr. mit Hilfe der Athener wieder aufgebaut und erlebte nun unter makedonischer Herrschaft eine neue Bl&#252;te. Es erhielt in der Antike aber nie mehr seine fr&#252;here Bedeutung zur&#252;ck.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]</German>

Estaba situada a 48 Km. al noroeste de Atenas. En tiempos antiguos fue la ciudad m&#225;s grande de esa regi&#243;n.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la actualidad, el lugar de la antigua ciudadela, Cadmea, se encuentra ocupado por la ciudad de Th&#237;va que fue reconstruida despu&#233;s del terremoto de 1893. La ciudad actual tiene 36.086 habitantes (2011).2 El gentilicio corresponde a tebano.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En tiempos antiguos fue la ciudad m&#225;s grande de la regi&#243;n de Beocia, territorio que estaba dividido en dos partes por el r&#237;o Onquestos, del que Tebas estaba situada al sur, y al norte se hallaba Orc&#243;meno. Estaba al pie de la monta&#241;a Teumessus; los riachuelos Ismenos (actual Ai Ianni) y Dirce (actual Platziotissa) pasaban cerca y un riachuelo de nombre Cnopos o Strofia divid&#237;a la ciudad en dos partes: al oeste Cadmea, y al sur la colina Ismenios y Anfion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tebas era famosa por sus siete puertas a las que hacen alusi&#243;n Homero y Hes&#237;odo. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La hegemon&#237;a tebana, en la Antigua Grecia, fue la &#233;poca que transcurre entre la victoria de la ciudad-estado de Tebas frente a Esparta en la Batalla de Leuctra en 371 a.

C., aunque Tebas intent&#243; mantener su posici&#243;n hasta que finalmente fueron eclipsados por el creciente poder de Macedonia en 346 a. C.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Externamente el camino para la hegemon&#237;a tebana fue pavimentado por el colapso del poder de Atenas en la Guerra del Peloponeso (431-404 a. C.) y el debilitamiento de Esparta por su oligantrop&#237;a (reducci&#243;n demogr&#225;fica) y la inconclusa Guerra de Corinto (395-386 a. C.). Internamente, los tebanos pudieron esgrimir dos ventajas militares temporales:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  Los l&#237;deres de la oligarqu&#237;a tebana de ese tiempo, Epaminondas y Pel&#243;pidas, estaban completamente dedicados a una pol&#237;tica exterior agresiva y ten&#237;an capacidad para ganar cualquier batalla.[NEWLINE]  Esos mismos l&#237;deres hab&#237;an implementado una serie de mejoras t&#225;cticas en la infanter&#237;a pesada de Tebas (por ejemplo, lanzas m&#225;s largas, o el uso de una formaci&#243;n oblicua innovadora), que en ese momento no ten&#237;a rival entre sus enemigos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los tebanos hab&#237;an disfrutado tradicionalmente de la hegemon&#237;a de la Liga Beocia, la federaci&#243;n olig&#225;rquica de griegos hablantes del dialecto de griego e&#243;lico, que limitaban al noroeste de la parte de &#193;tica dominada por Atenas. Su breve ascenso al poder fuera de las llanuras de Beocia comenz&#243; en 373 a. C., cuando los beocios derrotaron y destruyeron la ciudad de Platea, el &#250;nico aliado de Atenas en Beocia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Esto se consider&#243; una amenaza para el anterior poder hegem&#243;nico, Esparta, que lucharon por restaurar su posici&#243;n mediante una derrota decisiva frente a Tebas. Sin embargo, en Leuctra los tebanos derrotaron de forma aplastante a un ej&#233;rcito espartano. De 1.000 ciudadanos de &#233;lite espartanos, 400 de ellos murieron en Leuctra y tras ello los tebanos dominaron de forma sistem&#225;tica en Grecia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En el sur, invadieron el Peloponeso para liberar a Mesenia y a Arcadia del dominio espartano, y crearon una liga arcadia pro-tebana para poder controlar los asuntos del Peloponeso. En el norte invadieron Tesalia para acabar con el creciente fobierno local de Feres, y tomaron como reh&#233;n al que en un futuro ser&#237;a Filipo II de Macedonia. Pel&#243;pidas, sin embargo, muri&#243; en la batalla, a pesar de que los tebanos salieron victoriosos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los tebanos trataron de abarcar m&#225;s de lo que estrat&#233;gicamente eran capaces, por lo que en sus esfuerzos por mantener el control sobre el norte, su poder en el sur se fue desintegrando. El rey espartano Agesilao II logr&#243; reunir un ej&#233;rcito en contra Tebas en el que se inclu&#237;an varias ciudades del Peloponeso que no estaban satisfechas con el gobierno tebano. En la Batalla de Mantinea el ej&#233;rcito espartano fue derrotado, aunque lograron matar a Epaminondas en el transcurso de la misma.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La consecuencia fue una victoria p&#237;rrica para ambos estados. Esparta hab&#237;a perdido el poder y los recursos necesarios para volver a intentar retomar su posici&#243;n hegem&#243;nica, mientras que Tebas perdi&#243; a todos los l&#237;deres cuyo genio le hab&#237;an permitido llegar hasta d&#243;nde estaba. En esa situaci&#243;n, Tebas fue incapaz de mantener su posici&#243;n hegem&#243;nica y fue perdiendo el dominio sobre Grecia. Los tebanos intentaron mantener su posici&#243;n a trav&#233;s de la diplomacia y de su influencia en la Anfiction&#237;a de Delfos, pero el intento termin&#243; con sus antiguos aliados de Focia asediando Delfos y comenzando la Tercera Guerra Sagrada. Tebas demostr&#243; en la guerra que estaba ya demasiado desgastada como para llevar a t&#233;rmino el conflicto.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La guerra finalmente acab&#243; en 346 a. C., pero no gracias a las fuerzas de Tebas, o de ninguna otra ciudad-estado, sino de Filipo II de Macedonia, a quien hab&#237;an acudido las propias polis griegas en un momento de desesperaci&#243;n. Esto supuso el surgimiento de Macedonia dentro de Grecia, y puso un fin oficial a la hegemon&#237;a tebana que, en cualquier caso, llevaba ya declinando desde la muerte de Epaminondas en 362 a.

		<English>[H1]Athens[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Athens is one of the oldest named cities in the world, having been continuously inhabited for over 4000 years. Situated in southern Europe, Athens became the leading city of Ancient Greece in the first millennium BC and its cultural achievements during the 5th century BC laid the foundations of western civilization. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Prior to the rise of Athens, the city of Sparta considered itself to be the leader of the Greeks, or hegemon. In 499 BC Athens sent troops to aid the Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor, who were rebelling against the Persian Empire (the Ionian Revolt). This provoked two Persian invasions of Greece (see Persian Wars). In 490 BC the Athenians, led by the soldier-statesman Miltiades, defeated the first invasion of the Persians under Darius I at the Battle of Marathon. In 480 BC the Persians returned under Darius's son Xerxes. When a small Greek force holding the pass of Thermopylae was defeated, the Athenians evacuated Athens, which was taken by the Persians. Subsequently the Athenians (led by Themistocles), with their allies, engaged the much larger Persian navy at sea in the Battle of Salamis. Xerxes built a throne on the coast in order to watch the Greek navy being defeated, but instead, the Persians were routed. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]In 479 BC, the Athenians and Spartans, with their allies, defeated the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea. However, it was Athens that took the war to Asia Minor. These victories enabled it to bring most of the Aegean and many other parts of Greece together in the Delian League, an Athenian-dominated alliance. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Some of the most important figures of Western cultural and intellectual history lived in Athens during this period, the dramatists Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Euripides and Sophocles, the philosophers Aristotle, Plato and Socrates, the historians Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon and the sculptor Phidias. The leading statesman of this period was Pericles, who was responsible for assigning the leading artists of the time to beautify the Acropolis of classical Athens. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The resentment felt by other cities at the hegemony of Athens led to the Peloponnesian War, which began in 431 BC and pitted Athens and its increasingly rebellious overseas empire against a coalition of land-based states led by Sparta. The conflict led to the end of Athenian command of the sea. The war between the two city-states ended in a victory for Sparta. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]By the mid-4th century BC, however, the northern Greek kingdom of Macedon was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs, despite the warnings of the last great statesman of independent Athens, Demosthenes. In 338 BC the armies of Philip II defeated the other Greek cities at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Subsequently, the conquests of his son Alexander the Great widened Greek horizons and made the traditional Greek city state obsolete. Athens remained a wealthy city with a brilliant cultural life, but ceased to be an independent power. In the 2nd century BC, after 200 years of Macedonian supremacy, Greece was absorbed into the Roman Republic.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]</English>

In 480 BC the Persians returned under Darius's son Xerxes. When a small Greek force holding the pass of Thermopylae was defeated, the Athenians evacuated Athens, which was taken by the Persians. Subsequently the Athenians (led by Themistocles), with their allies, engaged the much larger Persian navy at sea in the Battle of Salamis. Xerxes built a throne on the coast in order to watch the Greek navy being defeated, but instead, the Persians were routed. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]In 479 BC, the Athenians and Spartans, with their allies, defeated the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea. However, it was Athens that took the war to Asia Minor. These victories enabled it to bring most of the Aegean and many other parts of Greece together in the Delian League, an Athenian-dominated alliance. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Some of the most important figures of Western cultural and intellectual history lived in Athens during this period, the dramatists Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Euripides and Sophocles, the philosophers Aristotle, Plato and Socrates, the historians Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon and the sculptor Phidias. The leading statesman of this period was Pericles, who was responsible for assigning the leading artists of the time to beautify the Acropolis of classical Athens. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The resentment felt by other cities at the hegemony of Athens led to the Peloponnesian War, which began in 431 BC and pitted Athens and its increasingly rebellious overseas empire against a coalition of land-based states led by Sparta. The conflict led to the end of Athenian command of the sea. The war between the two city-states ended in a victory for Sparta. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]By the mid-4th century BC, however, the northern Greek kingdom of Macedon was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs, despite the warnings of the last great statesman of independent Athens, Demosthenes. In 338 BC the armies of Philip II defeated the other Greek cities at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Subsequently, the conquests of his son Alexander the Great widened Greek horizons and made the traditional Greek city state obsolete. Athens remained a wealthy city with a brilliant cultural life, but ceased to be an independent power. In the 2nd century BC, after 200 years of Macedonian supremacy, Greece was absorbed into the Roman Republic.[PARAGRAPH:2:1]</French>
		<German>[H1]Die Athener[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Was konnten die Athener besonders gut? Die Athener konnten eigentlich alles besonders gut. Unter anderem hatten sie als erste eine Fr&#252;hform der Demokratie, eine unabh&#228;ngie Justiz und eine rationale Geschichtsschreibung. K&#252;nste und Wissenschaft erreichten in Athen eine nie gesehene Bl&#252;te. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Dem sagenhaften K&#246;nig Theseus wird zugeschrieben, die verschiedenen Teile der Landschaft Attika zu einer Polis vereinigt zu haben. Athen war fortan der Fl&#228;che nach der gr&#246;sste griechische Stadtstaat (vom Sonderfall Sparta abgesehen). Den H&#246;hepunkt seines politischen und kulturellen Einflusses erreichte Athen als Attische Demokratie und F&#252;hrungsmacht im attischen Seebund w&#228;hrend des 5. und 4. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. (klassische Zeit). Auch als die Stadt 86 v. Chr. dem R&#246;mischen Reich einverleibt wurde, behielt sie ihren Status als intellektuelles Zentrum und erreichte den H&#246;hepunkt ihrer urbanen Entwicklung im 2. Jahrhundert n. Chr. In der Reichskrise des 3. Jahrhunderts wurde Athen 267 von den germanischen Herulern erobert und gebrandschatzt, doch erholte sich die Stadt und blieb auch in der Sp&#228;tantike bedeutend. Dies &#228;nderte sich erst nach dem Jahr 529 n. Chr., als die letzten Philosophenschulen auf Anweisung des ostr&#246;mischen Kaisers Justinian I. geschlossen wurden. Die Einf&#228;lle der Slawen im sp&#228;ten 6. Jahrhundert liessen dann Athen endg&#252;ltig in Bedeutungslosigkeit versinken. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Die Demokratisierung des Stadtstaates begann im Jahre 510 v. Chr, als die B&#252;rger von Athen die beiden letzten Tyrannen verjagten, beziehungsweise ermordeten. Nachdem Athen die Perserkriege, die wohl bekanntesten Schlachten sind die von Marathon (490 v.Chr.) und von Salamis (480 v.Chr.), glorreich &#252;berstanden hatte, begannen die Athner, ihren Einflusssph&#228;re zu vergr&#246;ssern. Nach und nach machten sie einen nach dem anderen griechischen Stadtstaat von sich abh&#228;ngig und zwangen sie, dem Attischen Seebund beizutreten, gegr&#252;ndet 477 v.Chr.. Athen gelang es, diese Vormachtstellung durch eine starke Flotte zu sichern. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Wer im 5.Jahrhundert als Philosoph, Schriftsteller, Mathematiker oder K&#252;nstler etwas auf sich hielt, musste nach Athen. Gute Beispiele sind die auch heute noch gelesenen Schriftsteller Aischylos, Aristophanes, Euripides und Sophokles, die Historiker Herodot, Thukydides, der Philosoph Sokrates oder der Bildhauer Pheidias. Dabei hatte Athen knapp 40.000 Einwohner... [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Die Athenische Bev&#246;lkerung bestand jedoch gr&#246;sstenteils nicht aus Vollb&#252;rgern, sondern Sklaven oder Fremden (Met&#246;ken), die praktisch keine Rechte hatten. Der zu dieser Zeit einflussreichste Politiker der Stadt war Perikles, der die Akropolis mit viel Aufwand zu einer sch&#246;nsten und gr&#246;ssten Akropolis umgestaltete. Doch Athens Regierungspolitik wurde mit der Zeit nicht mehr von allen Mitgliedern des Attischen Seebunds unterst&#252;tzt. Die Differenzen mit Korinth (und indirekt mit Sparta) f&#252;hrten schliesslich zum Peloponnesischen Krieg gegen den so genannten Peloponnesischen Bund, der von Sparta angef&#252;hrt wurde. Perikles Strategie, sich der &#252;berlegenen spartanischen Armee nicht in offenem Kampf zu stellen und daf&#252;r mit der Flotte zu operieren, hatte keinen nachhaltigen Erfolg. Hinzu kam, dass von 430 v.Chr. bis 426 v.Chr. ein Drittel der Einwohner der Stadt an einer Epidemie starben. Nach DNA-Untersuchungen, die griechische Forscher der Nationalen und Kapodistrias-Universit&#228;t Athen 2006 an Skeletten aus dieser Zeit vornahmen, legen nahe, dass es sich dabei um Typhus handelte, nicht um die Pest, wie vorher angenommen wurde. Allerdings wurden diese Befunde kurz darauf wieder in Zweifel gezogen. Auch Perikles starb 429 v.Chr. an den Folgen dieser Epidemie. 421 v.Chr. kam es zum Nikiasfrieden, der allerdings nicht lange w&#228;hrte: Sparta ging gegen Argos vor, w&#228;hrend Athen sich dem langsam aufl&#246;senden Seebund zuwandte. 415 v.Chr. unternahmen die Athener, unter Einfluss des Alkibiades, die sogenannte sizilische Expedition, die 413 v.Chr. f&#252;r Athen in einem Desaster endete. Das Perserreich intervenierte zu Gunsten Spartas und trotz einiger Siege unterlagen die Athener 405 v.Chr. in der Schlacht bei Aigospotamoi. Der Krieg endete schliesslich 404 v.Chr. mit einer vollst&#228;ndigen Niederlage Athens, wobei die Spartaner darauf verzichteten, die Stadt des respektierten Feindes dem Erdboden gleich zu machen.</German>

[PARAGRAPH:2:1]Prior to the rise of Athens, the city of Sparta considered itself to be the leader of the Greeks, or hegemon.

		<English>[H1]The Babylonians[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]The Babylonian Empire was, rather than a new idea, a reinvigoration of the old Sumerian Empire, which had also occupied what is today Southern Iraq. Babylonia was formed from a collection of roughly a dozen city states and was named for its capital city of Babylon. Originally a disorganized region, Babylon and Babylonia began to grow as a center for culture, trade, and religion under the rule of Hammurabi in 1728BC.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hammurabi was the first known ruler of united Babylonia as well as its greatest lawgiver. Hammurabi's Code of Laws regulated Babylonian life in such a way as to make the consequences of most criminal acts publicly known. Citizens could then structure their behavior based on these laws leading to a more organized society. So comprehensive was the Babylonian Code that little about its laws or governmental system changed in the entirety of its 1,200 years of existence. Babylon was so revered for this system that cities and states as far as the Mediterranean would emulate it for centuries.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the death of Hammurabi (1750 BC), the empire slowly declined in power and influence until it was eventually conquered by the Kassites (around 1600 BC) from what are now the mountains of Iran. The Kassites ruled over Babylonia for 576 years, reinvigorating the empire under their reign. Although Hammurabi ruled over Babylonia as a series of interconnected city states, the Kassites were the first rulers of Babylonia to transform the country into an organized territory. The Kassites created trade routes to countries as far away as Greece, Armenia and Turkey. Trade with these nations brought further wealth and status to Babylonia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Towards the end of the Kassite era of rule, Babylonia once again began to fall into decline, in part due to external political and military pressure. In 627 BC, the last Kassite ruler died, and Babylonia revolted under the command of a new leader, Nabopolassar. Nabopolassar's son, Nebuchadnezzar II, ruled Babylonia and brought about another golden era. During his rule, Babylonia became a military power, invading and taking territory in Egypt and Assyria. Not long afterwards, in 539 BC, Cyrus of Persia invaded Babylonia, conquering it, and forever ending Babylonia's existence as an independent territory.[PARAGRAPH:1]Despite numerous regime changes, education reached exceptional heights among the Babylonians. Technical achievements such as the creation of a base 60, "sexigesimal," system of mathematics, are still used to this day. Sixty seconds per minute, sixty minutes per hour: modern time, is in fact, Babylonian time.[PARAGRAPH:1]Much like the Sumerian Empire from which they were descended, Babylonia was a nation of fanatical record-keepers. Starting with Hammurabi and continuing down until the empire's dissolution at the hands of Cyrus and the great Persian emperors, every financial transaction, every court verdict, every contract, and just about anything that could be written down, was-on clay tablets. With laws pertaining to almost every aspect of daily living, a significant amount of data was recorded, and much of this has been uncovered and excavated during the modern era. Researchers have even found several optical devices, similar to magnifying glasses, which were used to allow record keepers to write in smaller cuneiform, in order to fit more information on each clay tablet.[PARAGRAPH:1]Babylonia played an important role in the development of law throughout the world. The creation of Hammurabi's Code of Laws, and the zeal with which his successors, both blood-related and not, upheld those laws, demonstrated for all of history how successful and wealthy a nation could become by following an organized system of government.</English>

Le fils de Nabopolassar, Nabuchodonosor II, r&#232;gne sur la Babylonie et provoque un nouvel &#226;ge d'or. Pendant son r&#232;gne, la Babylonie devient une puissance militaire, envahissant et annexant une partie de l'Egypte et de l'Assyrie. Peu de temps apr&#232;s, en 539 av. J.C., Cyrus de Perse envahit la Babylonie, mettant un terme d&#233;finitif &#224; son existence en tant que territoire ind&#233;pendant.[PARAGRAPH:1]Malgr&#233; de nombreux changements de r&#233;gime, l'&#233;ducation babylonienne atteint des sommets exceptionnels.

		<German>[H1]Babylonien[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Das babylonische Reich war weniger eine neue Idee als eine Neuauflage des alten Sumerischen Reiches, das ebenfalls das Gebiet des heutigen S&#252;diraks umfasst hatte. Babylonien entstand aus einer Sammlung von grob einem Dutzend Stadtstaaten und wurde nach der Hauptstadt Babylon benannt. Babylon und Babylonien, urspr&#252;nglich eine wenig organisierte Region, entwickelten sich unter der Herrschaft Hammurabis 1728 v. Chr. zu einem kulturellen, religi&#246;sen und kommerziellen Zentrum.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hammurabi war der erste bekannte Herrscher eines vereinten Babylonien, und dessen gr&#246;&#223;ter Gesetzgeber. Der Kodex Hammurabi regelte das Leben in Babylonien auf eine Weise, dass die Konsequenzen der meisten kriminellen Handlungen &#246;ffentlich bekannt wurden. Die B&#252;rger konnten daraufhin ihr Verhalten an diesen Gesetzen ausrichten, was zu einer gr&#246;&#223;eren Best&#228;ndigkeit innerhalb der Gesellschaft f&#252;hrte. Der Kodex war so umfassend, dass in den gesamten 1.200 Jahren seiner Existenz nur wenig an seinen Gesetzen oder dem Regierungssystem ver&#228;ndert wurde. Babylonien wurde f&#252;r dieses System so verehrt, dass sogar weit entfernt im Mittelmeer St&#228;dte und Staaten es jahrhundertelang nachahmten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach dem Tod Hammurabis (1750 v. Chr.) verlor das Reich allm&#228;hlich an Macht und Einfluss, bis es schlie&#223;lich von den Kassiten erobert wurde (ungef&#228;hr 1600 v. Chr.), die aus den Bergen des heutigen Iran stammten. Die Kassiten herrschten 576 Jahre lang &#252;ber Babylonien und unter ihrer Herrschaft gewann das Reich neue Kraft. Hammurabi hatte Babylonien zwar als einen Verbund von Stadtstaaten regiert, doch die Kassiten waren die ersten Herrscher Babyloniens, die das Land in ein organisiertes Territorium verwandelten. Die Kassiten erschlossen Handelswege bis in so entfernte L&#228;nder wie Griechenland, Armenien und die T&#252;rkei. Der Handel mit diesen V&#246;lkern brachte Babylonien weiteren Reichtum und mehr Ansehen ein.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gegen Ende der kassitischen Herrschafts&#228;ra begann Babylonien erneut zu verfallen, was teils auf &#228;u&#223;eren politischen und milit&#228;rischen Druck zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren war. 627 v. Chr. starb der letzte kassitische Herrscher und in Babylonien erhob sich ein Aufstand unter einem neuen Anf&#252;hrer, Nabopolassar. Nabopolassars Sohn Nebukadnezar II. f&#252;hrte als Herrscher Babyloniens ein weiteres Goldenes Zeitalter herbei. Unter seiner Herrschaft wurde Babylonien zu einer Milit&#228;rmacht, die Gebiete in &#196;gypten und Assyrien angriff und eroberte. Nur wenig sp&#228;ter, 539 v. Chr., fiel Cyrus von Persien in Babylonien ein und beendete nach erfolgreicher Eroberung die Existenz Babyloniens als unabh&#228;ngiges Gebiet ein f&#252;r alle Mal.[PARAGRAPH:1]Trotz zahlreicher Regierungswechsel erreichte die Bildung unter Babyloniern einen au&#223;ergew&#246;hnlich hohen Stand. Technische Errungenschaften wie die Schaffung einer auf der Zahl 60 basierenden, "sexagesimalen" Mathematik werden noch heute verwendet. Sechzig Sekunden pro Minute, sechzig Minuten pro Stunden-die moderne Zeitrechnung ist in Wirklichkeit babylonisch.[PARAGRAPH:1]&#196;hnlich wie das Sumerische Reich, aus dem es sich entwickelt hatte, war Babylonien ein Volk fanatischer Chronisten. Von Hammurabi an bis zur Aufl&#246;sung des Reichs durch Cyrus und die gro&#223;en persischen Kaiser wurde jede finanzielle Transaktion, jedes Gerichtsurteil, jeder Vertrag und so ziemlich alles, was schriftlich festgehalten werden konnte, niedergeschrieben-auf Lehmtafeln. Da beinahe jeder Aspekt des Alltagslebens gesetzlich geregelt war, wurde eine bedeutende Menge Daten festgehalten, und in der Gegenwart wurde ein Gro&#223;teil entdeckt und ausgegraben. Forscher haben sogar verschiedene optische Ger&#228;te gefunden, die Lupen &#228;hneln und die benutzt wurden, um es Chronisten zu erm&#246;glichen, in kleinerer Keilschrift zu schreiben, damit auf eine Lehmtafel mehr Informationen passten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Babylonien spielte bei der weltweiten Entwicklung von Gesetzen eine gro&#223;e Rolle. Die Schaffung des Kodex Hammurabi und der Eifer, mit dem seine Nachfolger, blutsverwandt oder nicht, an diesen Gesetzen festhielten, zeigte der gesamten Geschichte, wie reich eine Nation werden konnte, wenn sie sich an ein organisiertes Regierungssystem hielt.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Babilonia[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]L'Impero Babilonese, pi&#249; che essere un nuovo regno, era un rafforzamento del vecchio Impero Sumero, che occupava anche l'attuale Iraq meridionale. Babilonia era composta da circa una dozzina di citt&#224;-stato e prendeva il nome dalla propria capitale. Pur essendo originariamente una regione disorganizzata, Babilonia cominci&#242; a crescere come centro culturale, commerciale e religioso sotto il regno di Hammurabi, nel 1728 a.C.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hammurabi fu il primo re conosciuto di una Babilonia unita, cos&#236; come il suo pi&#249; grande legislatore. Il Codice di Hammurabi regol&#242; la vita dei Babilonesi in un modo tale da rendere pubblicamente conosciute le conseguenze della maggior parte degli atti criminali. I cittadini potevano cos&#236; regolare il proprio comportamento su tali leggi, il che port&#242; a una societ&#224; pi&#249; organizzata. Il Codice di Hammurabi era cos&#236; completo che cambi&#242; ben poco durante i 1200 anni in cui venne utilizzato. Babilonia era cos&#236; onorata per questo sistema che citt&#224; e stati fino al Mediterraneo l'avrebbero emulata per secoli.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dopo la morte di Hammurabi (1750 a.C.), il potere e l'influenza dell'impero diminuirono lentamente fino a quando fu conquistato dai Cassiti (intorno al 1600 a.C.), provenienti da quelle che oggi sono le montagne dell'Iran. I Cassiti regnarono su Babilonia per 576 anni, rinvigorendo l'impero con il loro regno. La Babilonia di Hammurabi era composta da una serie di citt&#224;-stato tra loro collegate, mentre i Cassiti furono i primi regnanti di Babilonia a trasformare il Paese in un territorio organizzato. Crearono delle rotte commerciali fino a Paesi lontani come Grecia, Armenia e Turchia. Il commercio con queste nazioni fece aumentare ulteriormente l'importanza e la ricchezza di Babilonia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Verso la fine dell'era dei Cassiti, Babilonia cominci&#242; ancora una volta a decadere, in parte a causa della pressione politica e militare esterna. Nel 627 a.C. mor&#236; l'ultimo regnante dei Cassiti e Babilonia si ribell&#242; sotto il comando di un nuovo capo, Nabopolassar. Il figlio di Nabopolassar, Nabucodonosor II, regn&#242; su Babilonia e diede inizio a un'altra epoca d'oro. Durante il suo governo, Babilonia divent&#242; una potenza militare, invadendo e occupando territori in Egitto e Assiria. Dopo non molto, nel 539 a.C., Ciro di Persia invase la Babilonia e la conquist&#242;, ponendo per sempre fine alla sua esistenza come territorio indipendente.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nonostante numerosi cambiamenti di regime, l'educazione raggiunse vette eccezionali presso i Babilonesi. Conquiste tecniche come la creazione di un sistema matematico "sessagesimale", su base 60, vengono utilizzati ancora oggi. Sessanta secondi al minuto, sessanta minuti in un'ora: il tempo moderno &#232; infatti il tempo babilonese.[PARAGRAPH:1]I Babilonesi, proprio come i Sumeri da cui discendevano, archiviavano tutto, quasi con fanatismo. Cominciando con Hammurabi e continuando fino alla sparizione dell'impero per mano di Ciro e dei grandi imperatori persiani, ogni transazione finanziaria, ogni verdetto di corte, ogni contratto e in pratica quasi tutto ci&#242; che poteva essere scritto veniva appunto scritto su tavolette d'argilla. Avendo delle leggi che regolavano quasi ogni aspetto della vita giornaliera, &#232; stata registrata una gran quantit&#224; di dati, molti dei quali sono stati scoperti durante l'era moderna. I ricercatori hanno addirittura trovato diversi apparecchi ottici, simili a lenti di ingrandimento, che venivano utilizzati per scrivere caratteri ancora pi&#249; piccoli, per poter includere ancora pi&#249; informazioni su ogni singola tavoletta.[PARAGRAPH:1]Babilonia ebbe un ruolo importante nello sviluppo della legge in tutto il mondo. La creazione del Codice di Hammurabi, e lo zelo con cui i suoi successori mantennero queste leggi dimostr&#242; a tutti nella storia quanto una nazione potesse ottenere successo e ricchezze seguendo un sistema di governo organizzato.</Italian>

Con &#233;l, los ciudadanos pod&#237;an estructurar su comportamiento, lo que se traduc&#237;a en una sociedad m&#225;s organizada. El C&#243;digo era tan exhaustivo que experiment&#243; muy pocos cambios a lo largo de sus casi 1.200 a&#241;os de existencia.

C.) de las monta&#241;as del Ir&#225;n moderno. Los casitas gobernaron Babilonia durante 576 a&#241;os, y con ellos el imperio recobr&#243; su viejo vigor. Aunque Hammurabi hab&#237;a gobernado Babilonia como una serie de ciudades-estado interconectadas, los casitas fueron los primeros que transformaron el pa&#237;s en un territorio organizado. En este per&#237;odo se crearon rutas comerciales hasta lugares tan lejanos como Grecia, Armenia y Turqu&#237;a. El comercio con estas naciones aument&#243; la riqueza y el prestigio de Babilonia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hacia el final del per&#237;odo casita, Babilonia volvi&#243; a caer en declive, en parte por culpa de la presi&#243;n pol&#237;tica y militar proveniente del exterior.

		<English>[H1]The Sumerians[\H1][NEWLINE]The Sumerian Empire was founded along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, in modern day Iraq, in roughly 3000 BC. Sumeria was the world's first civilization and created the world's first historians through the invention of cuneiform, the original written language. [NEWLINE]The Sumerian people were organized into a series of carefully irrigated city-states, each with its own ruler and local deities. The surplus of wheat grown from the verdant fertility of the Tigris and Euphrates allowed the Sumerians to create an exceptional urban civilization. Never numbering more than a dozen or so, the cities of Sumeria were major centers of commerce, culture and defense, and the Sumerians were the first truly metropolitan population. In fact, the Sumerian creation myth states that first there was nothing; then there was a city-Eridu.[NEWLINE]Sumerian cities were seas of sun-cooked brick, rushing irrigation ditches and mountainous ziggurats (the Sumerian temples to the gods). Facing near-constant warfare, each city was defined by a series of intimidating walls and well-placed canals. Indeed, the Sumerians are the first people known to employ a professional army, necessary to fight the perpetual skirmishes that characterized Sumerian daily life.[NEWLINE]Unity in Sumeria was only established at the end of a spear. The first Sumerian King to lay claim over a number of cities was Eannatum of Lagash. Initiating a campaign against the city of Umma (Lagash's ancient rival) over a border dispute, Eannatum followed up his victory by sweeping over and conquering the remainder of Sumeria. An uprising within Umma would later shatter this new empire, but a mutual treaty would again bring peace to Sumeria.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, the Sumerians were not alone in the Fertile Crescent. Their competitors included the Akkadians, a Semetic people to the North. In 2334 BC, Sargon, a highly skilled military strategist, was born in Akkadia. Upon reaching maturity, Sargon would found his own dynasty-the Akkadians-bringing all the peoples of the Fertile Crescent, including the Sumerians, under his rule.[NEWLINE]In roughly 2250 BC, a new people, the Gutians, thundered into the Fertile Crescent, deposing the Akkadians and establishing themselves as the new rulers of the land. But the rigors of invasion severely weakened the new overlords of Mesopotamia, allowing the long-dominated Sumerians the chance for rebellion. With the rise of a new leader, Utu-khegal, the Sumerians threw off their Gutian overlords and reestablished the supremacy of Sumerian culture throughout the Fertile Crescent.[NEWLINE]Under Ur-Nammu, a successor of Utu-khegal, order was restored in the fractured state, and the period of The Third Dynasty of Ur began. Ur-Nammu was a reformer and builder as well as a warrior, and he created roads and walls throughout his new empire. This golden age would last until 2004 BC, when internal feuding fractured the Sumerian nation decisively.[NEWLINE]The story of Sumeria comes to us through the many cuneiform tablets that have been discovered. Unfortunately, many of these tablets aren't especially evocative: tireless record-keepers, the Sumerians would just as often record the season's flock of sheep as the reign of ancient kings. Several tablets, though, have been of a religious nature and have provided great insights into the foundation of Judeo-Christian beliefs. Tales of a great flood abound in Sumerian myth. Man, they said, was formed from clay.[NEWLINE]Although the first great empire vanished from history, Sumerian culture would survive to influence the next great civilization to spring from the Tigris-Euphrates Valley-Babylon.</English>

Le Sumer est la premi&#232;re civilisation mondiale et cr&#233;e les premiers historiens du monde gr&#226;ce &#224; l'invention du cun&#233;iforme, l'un des premiers langages &#233;crits.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les Sum&#233;riens sont organis&#233;s en une s&#233;rie de villes soigneusement irrigu&#233;es, chacune avec son propre chef et divinit&#233;s locales. L'exc&#233;dent de bl&#233; cultiv&#233; sur les rives fertiles du Tigre et de l'Euphrate permet aux Sum&#233;riens de cr&#233;er une exceptionnelle civilisation urbaine. Les villes sum&#233;riennes, qui ne seront jamais plus d'une dizaine environ, sont d'importants centres commerciaux, culturels et d&#233;fensifs et les Sum&#233;riens constituent la premi&#232;re population r&#233;ellement m&#233;tropolitaine. D'ailleurs, le mythe sum&#233;rien de la cr&#233;ation proclame qu'au premier jour, il n'y avait rien, puis qu'apparut une cit&#233; : Eridu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les villes sum&#233;riennes sont construites en terre cuite, avec des foss&#233;s d'irrigation et d'immenses ziggourats (temples sum&#233;riens d&#233;di&#233;s aux dieux). Presque constamment en guerre, chaque ville est gard&#233;e par d'impressionnantes murailles et des canaux plac&#233;s &#224; des endroits strat&#233;giques. D'ailleurs, les Sum&#233;riens sont les premiers &#224; employer une arm&#233;e professionnelle, pour lutter contre les querelles perp&#233;tuelles au Sumer.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'unit&#233; sum&#233;rienne n'a pu &#234;tre &#233;tablie qu'au bout d'une lance. Eannatum de Lagash est le premier roi sum&#233;rien &#224; avoir des pr&#233;tentions sur plusieurs villes. Apr&#232;s avoir men&#233; campagne contre la cit&#233; d'Umma (l'ancienne rivale de Lagash) pour une question de fronti&#232;res, Eannatum entreprend de conqu&#233;rir le reste du Sumer. Une r&#233;volte au sein d'Umma d&#233;truira son nouvel empire, mais un trait&#233; mutuel ram&#232;nera la paix.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cependant, les Sum&#233;riens ne sont pas seuls dans le Croissant fertile. Parmi leurs principaux rivaux se trouvent les Akkadiens, peuple s&#233;mitique du nord. En 2334 av. J.C., Sargon, un talentueux strat&#232;ge, na&#238;t en Akkadie. Sargon fonde sa propre dynastie, les Akkadiens, et place tous les peuples du Croissant fertile sous son commandement.[PARAGRAPH:1]Vers 2250 av J.C. un nouveau peuple, les Gutis, envahit le Croissant fertile, d&#233;tr&#244;ne les Akkadiens et s'&#233;tablit en dirigeant de la r&#233;gion. Mais les rigueurs de l'invasion affaiblissent gravement les nouveaux chefs de la M&#233;sopotamie et permettent aux Sum&#233;riens de se rebeller. Apr&#232;s l'av&#232;nement d'un nouveau chef, Utu-khegal, les Sum&#233;riens chassent les Gutis et r&#233;tablissent la supr&#233;matie de la culture sum&#233;rienne au sein du Croissant fertile.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sous Ur-Nammu, successeur d'Utu-khegal, l'ordre est restaur&#233; dans l'Etat divis&#233; et l'&#232;re de la Troisi&#232;me dynastie d'Ur commence. Ur-Nammu est un r&#233;formateur, un b&#226;tisseur et un guerrier et il cr&#233;e de nombreuses routes et murailles &#224; travers son nouvel empire. Cet &#226;ge d'or durera jusqu'en 2004 av. J.C., quand des querelles internes provoquent la fin de la nation sum&#233;rienne.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'histoire du Sumer nous est parvenue gr&#226;ce &#224; la d&#233;couverte de nombreuses tablettes cun&#233;iformes. Malheureusement, nombre de ces tablettes ne sont pas sp&#233;cialement &#233;vocatrices : infatigables archivistes, les Sum&#233;riens notaient avec autant de z&#232;le le nombre de moutons que le r&#232;gne des anciens rois.

		<German>[H1]Die Sumerer[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Das Sumerische Reich wurde entlang der Ufer der Fl&#252;sse Euphrat und Tigris gegr&#252;ndet, im heutigen Irak, ungef&#228;hr 3000 v. Chr. Sumer war die erste Zivilisation der Welt und brachte durch die Erfindung der Keilschrift, der urspr&#252;nglichen Schriftsprache, die ersten Historiker der Welt hervor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Volk von Sumer war in einer Reihe sorgf&#228;ltig bew&#228;sserter Stadtstaaten organisiert, von denen jeder seinen eigenen Herrscher und eigene Lokalgottheiten hatte. Der &#220;berschuss an Weizen, der auf den fruchtbaren Feldern an Euphrat und Tigris wuchs, erm&#246;glichte es den Sumerern, eine au&#223;ergew&#246;hnliche st&#228;dtische Zivilisation zu erschaffen. Obwohl sie nie mehr als ungef&#228;hr ein Dutzend z&#228;hlten, waren die sumerischen St&#228;dte bedeutende Zentren des Handels, der Kultur und der Verteidigung, und die Sumerer bildeten die erste echte Stadtbev&#246;lkerung. Tats&#228;chlich besagt der sumerische Sch&#246;pfungsmythos, dass am Anfang das Nichts war und dann eine Stadt-Eridu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sumerische St&#228;dte waren Meere aus sonnengebrannte Ziegel, brausenden Bew&#228;sserungsgr&#228;ben und berghohen Zikkuraten (sumerische G&#246;ttertempel). Angesichts beinahe stetig andauernder Kriege war jede Stadt von einer Reihe furchteinfl&#246;&#223;ender Mauern und gut platzierter Kan&#228;le umgeben. In der Tat waren die Sumerer das erste Volk, von dem bekannt ist, dass es eine Berufsarmee einsetzte, welche die ewigen Scharm&#252;tzel ausfocht, die kennzeichnend f&#252;r das allt&#228;gliche Leben in Sumer waren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eintracht entstand in Sumer nur durch die Spitze eines Speers. Der erste sumerische K&#246;nig, der mehrere St&#228;dte beanspruchte, war Eannatum von Lagasch. Eannatum begann anl&#228;sslich eines Grenzstreits einen Feldzug gegen die Stadt Umma (Lagaschs uralten Rivalen) und lie&#223; seinem Sieg den &#220;berfall auf und die Eroberung des restlichen Sumers folgen. Ein Aufstand in Umma sollte sp&#228;ter sein neues Reich zerschmettern, doch ein wechselseitiger Vertrag w&#252;rde Sumer erneut Frieden schenken.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Sumerer waren jedoch im Fruchtbaren Halbmond nicht allein. Zu ihren Konkurrenten geh&#246;rten die Akkader, ein semitisches Volk im Norden. 2334 v. Chr. wurde Sargon, ein &#228;u&#223;erst begabter Milit&#228;rstratege, in Akkad geboren. Nach Erlangen der Mannesreife sollte Sargon seine eigene Dynastie gr&#252;nden-die Akkader-und alle V&#246;lker des Fruchtbaren Halbmonds, darunter die Sumerer, unter seine Herrschaft bringen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ungef&#228;hr 2250 v. Chr. brach ein neues Volk, die Gut&#228;er, &#252;ber den Fruchtbaren Halbmond herein, setzte die Akkader ab und etablierte sich selbst als die neuen Herren des Landes. Doch die H&#228;rten der Invasion schw&#228;chten die neuen Herren Mesopotamiens rasch, und gaben den lang unterdr&#252;ckten Sumerern die M&#246;glichkeit zur Rebellion. Mit dem Aufstieg ihres neuen Anf&#252;hrers, Utu-Khegal, &#252;berwarfen die Sumerer ihre gut&#228;ischen Herren und stellten die Vorherrschaft der sumerischen Kultur im gesamten Fruchtbaren Halbmond wieder her.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unter Ur-Nammu, einem Nachfolger Utu-Khegals, wurde in dem zersplitterten Staat wieder f&#252;r Ordnung gesorgt und es begann die Epoche der Dritten Dynastie von Ur. Ur-Nammu war ebenso Reformer und Erbauer wie Krieger und schuf in seinem gesamten neuen Reich Stra&#223;en und Mauern. Dieses Goldene Zeitalter sollte bis 2004 v. Chr. andauern, als innere K&#228;mpfe die Nation der Sumerer entscheidend spalteten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Geschichte Sumers ist uns durch die vielen entdeckten Keilschrifttafeln &#252;berliefert. Leider sind viele dieser Tafeln nicht sehr vielsagend. Als unerm&#252;dliche Chronisten zeichneten die Sumerer ebenso oft die Anzahl Schafe in einer bestimmten Jahreszeit auf wie die Herrschaft antiker K&#246;nige. Mehrere Tafeln haben jedoch einen religi&#246;sen Hintergrund und haben gro&#223;artige Einblicke in das Fundament des j&#252;disch-christlichen Glaubens geliefert. Geschichten &#252;ber eine gro&#223;e Flut sind in sumerischen Mythen im &#220;berfluss vorhanden. Der Mensch, so hei&#223;t es, wurde aus Lehm geformt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Obwohl das erste gro&#223;e Reich aus der Geschichte verschwunden ist, sollte die sumerische Kultur &#252;berleben und die n&#228;chste gro&#223;e Zivilisation beeinflussen, die sich aus dem Tal des Euphrat und Tigris erheben sollte-Babylon.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]I Sumeri[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]I Sumeri erano organizzati in una serie di irrigue citt&#224;-stato, ognuna con il proprio governatore e divinit&#224; locali. Il frumento in eccesso ottenuto grazie alla fertilit&#224; del Tigri e dell'Eufrate permise ai Sumeri di creare un'eccezionale civilt&#224; urbana. Mai pi&#249; di una dozzina, le citt&#224;-stato dei Sumeri erano grossi centri commerciali, culturali e di difesa, e i Sumeri furono la prima vera popolazione metropolitana. Infatti la mitologia della creazione sumera racconta che prima non c'era nulla, e poi ci fu la prima citt&#224;: Eridu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le citt&#224; sumere erano distese di mattoni cotti dal sole, canali d'irrigazione e montagnose Ziggurat (i templi sumeri alle divinit&#224;). Per far fronte al continuo stato di guerra, ogni citt&#224; era delimitata da possenti mura e canali ben sistemati. Addirittura, i Sumeri furono la prima popolazione a utilizzare un esercito professionale, indispensabile per combattere i continui scontri che caratterizzavano la vita quotidiana.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'unit&#224; della Sumeria poteva essere raggiunta solamente con la punta di una lancia. Il primo re sumero a rivendicare potere su pi&#249; citt&#224; fu Eannatum di Lagash. Dopo aver iniziato la campagna contro la citt&#224; di Umma (l'antica rivale di Lagash) a causa di una disputa sui confini, Eannatum segu&#236; lo slancio della propria vittoria e conquist&#242; il resto della Sumeria. Una rivolta di Umma spezz&#242; pi&#249; tardi in due il neonato impero, ma un trattato congiunto port&#242; di nuovo la pace in Sumeria.[PARAGRAPH:1]I Sumeri per&#242; non erano i soli ad abitare la "mezzaluna fertile". Fra i loro concorrenti ci sono gli Accadiani, un popolo semita a nord. Nel 2334 a.C. in Accadia nacque Sargon, un abile stratega militare. Quando raggiunse la maturit&#224;, Sargon fond&#242; la propria dinastia, quella degli Accadiani, portando sotto il proprio dominio tutte le genti della mezzaluna fertile, inclusi i Sumeri.[PARAGRAPH:1]Attorno al 2250 a.C. una nuova popolazione, i Gutiani, si fece strada in Mesopotamia, deponendo gli Accadiani e imponendosi come nuovi signori di quella terra. Ma i rigori dell'invasione avevano seriamente indebolito i nuovi dominatori della mezzaluna fertile, dando ai Sumeri la possibilit&#224; di ribellarsi. &#200; con l'avvento di un nuovo capo, Utu-khegal, che i Sumeri si liberano dei dominatori gutiani e ristabiliscono la supremazia della cultura sumera nell'intera mezzaluna fertile.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sotto Ur-Nammu, successore di Utu-khegal, venne ristabilito l'ordine nella nazione divisa e cominci&#242; il periodo della Terza Dinastia di Ur. Ur-Nammu fu un riformatore e un costruttore, oltre che un guerriero, e cre&#242; strade e mura in tutto il suo nuovo impero. Questo periodo particolarmente favorevole sarebbe durato fino al 2004 a.C., quando i conflitti intestini divisero definitivamente la nazione sumera.[PARAGRAPH:1]La storia della Sumeria c'&#232; arrivata attraverso la scrittura cuneiforme sulle molte tavolette ritrovate. Sfortunatamente molte di queste non sono particolarmente evocative: i Sumeri amavano archiviare tutto, tanto il numero di pecore in una stagione quanto il regno di antichi re. Molte tavolette erano per&#242; di natura religiosa e c'hanno fornito una grande comprensione delle fondamenta della fede giudeo-cristiana. Racconti di una grande inondazione abbondano tra i miti sumeri e l'uomo, dicevano, era stato creato con l'argilla.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nonostante il primo grande impero sia svanito nella storia, la cultura sumera sarebbe sopravvissuta all'influenza della successiva grande civilt&#224; nata nella valle del Tigri e dell'Eufrate: Babilonia.</Italian>

		<English>[H1]Carthage[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Carthage was an ancient city-state in North Africa located somewhere near the site of modern Tunis. It was settled by Phoenician colonists from the city of Tyre sometime around 814 BC. According to tradition, the first ruler was a queen named Dido, who is mentioned in a number of surviving Greek and Roman legends. Carthage had an excellent harbor, and the city was well situated to form a maritime empire based on Mediterranean trade. As time passed and Carthage expanded, it gained control over the other Phoenician colonies on the northern coast of Africa. Carthaginian merchants dominated trade in the western Mediterranean, and navigators may have sailed as far as Britain and Nigeria. The rise of Carthage in power and influence would bring it into conflict with first the Greek city-states of Sicily, and later the Roman Republic. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Carthage's government was an oligarchy not unlike that in republican Rome. One or two "Sofetim" (which best translates as "judges") were elected annually from among the wealthy and influential families of Carthage to hold positions of executive and judicial power. These aristocratic families were also represented in a deliberative body that appears to have been similar to the Roman Senate. Although Carthage was primarily controlled by these oligarchs, there were also a few limited elections for minor positions of authority within the government. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Carthage's economic prosperity was based largely upon its lucrative trade with the silver and tin mines of Spain, and those trade routes were jealously guarded by Carthaginian merchants. Culturally, the Carthaginians practiced the polytheistic religion of the Phoenicians, based upon worship of the divine couple Tanit and Ba'al. The Carthaginians also appear to have participated in the unsavory practice of child sacrifice as part of their religion, although some historians have disputed this. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Carthage first came into military conflict with the Greeks over control of the island of Sicily, whose strategic location would allow the Carthaginians to control access to the western Mediterranean. Carthage fought three separate wars against the Greek colonies on Sicily, all of which largely ended in inconclusive stalemates. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Eventually Rome occupied the Greek colonies in the south of mainland Italy, allowing Carthage an opportunity to conquer most of Sicily. Tension between the two states soon boiled over into the First Punic War (264-241 BC) during which the Romans recovered from initial setbacks and built a navy for the first time, with which they defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of the Aegates Islands. This victory won Sicily for Rome, and the two sides entered into an uneasy peace. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]After losing Sicily to the Romans, the Carthaginians expanded their holdings in Spain to compensate. They also began to prepare for a second conflict with Rome. The war faction was led by the members of the Barca family, and in particular the soon-to-be-famous Hannibal. When a border dispute in Spain provoked an incident between the two states, the Carthaginian senate declared war, initiating the Second Punic War (218-202 BC). [PARAGRAPH:2:1]During this conflict Hannibal was authorized to lead a campaign into Italy. He led his large force-which included war elephants-across the Alps, taking the Romans completely by surprise (and creating one of the most enduring war stories of all time). Hannibal met and soundly defeated the main Roman army at Lake Trasimene (217). Despite this disaster the Romans mustered up an even larger army the following year. The two forces met at Cannae, and employing a series of brilliant tactical maneuvers, Hannibal once again utterly destroyed the Romans. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Following this grisly slaughter, the Romans adopted a Fabian strategy of retreat, refusing to give battle against Hannibal. Hannibal continued to devastate the Italian countryside for the next decade, but he was unable to knock Rome out of the war. Meanwhile, the Roman general Scipio attacked Carthage's holdings in Spain, gaining complete control of the region by 206. Scipio then led an expedition to Africa itself, and Hannibal was recalled from Italy to defend the city of Carthage. The two sides met at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC and Hannibal was defeated, Scipio taking the name "Africanus" to celebrate his victory. Carthage was forced to sue for peace, and Rome imposed very harsh terms on the city. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Despite the destruction of the Second Punic War and the harsh peace terms, Carthage soon recovered her strength and began once more to exert control over trade in the Western Mediterranean. This caused great fear among the Romans, who had never forgotten the damage that Hannibal had done to Italy in the earlier war. In 149 BC Rome declared war on Carthage again on spurious pretexts, initiating the Third Punic War. The Carthaginians attempted to negotiate a settlement, but the Romans would be satisfied with nothing less than the city's total destruction. After a long siege, the city fell and its people were killed or sold into slavery. Carthage itself was pulled apart brick by brick and completely destroyed. The city would be rebuilt by the Romans, but the former Phoenician state would never rise again. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]</English>
		<French>[H1]Carthage[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Carthage est une cit&#233;-Etat antique en Afrique du Nord, situ&#233;e &#224; proximit&#233; de l'actuelle ville de Tunis. Elle fut fond&#233;e par des colonisateurs ph&#233;niciens originaires de la ville de Tyr vers 814 av. J.-C. On raconte que son premier dirigeant &#233;tait une reine nomm&#233;e Didon (Elyssa pour les Romains), mentionn&#233;e dans plusieurs l&#233;gendes grecques et romaines qui nous sont parvenues. Carthage dispose d'un excellent port et la ville est bien plac&#233;e pour b&#226;tir un empire maritime fond&#233; sur le commerce m&#233;diterran&#233;en. Au fil du temps et de l'expansion de Carthage, la ville obtient le contr&#244;le des autres colonies ph&#233;niciennes de la c&#244;te nord de l'Afrique. Les marchands carthaginois contr&#244;lent le commerce en M&#233;diterran&#233;e occidentale et des navigateurs y sont sans doute venus de contr&#233;es aussi lointaines que la Grande-Bretagne ou le Nigeria. La mont&#233;e en puissance et en influence de Carthage la font entrer en conflit d'abord avec les cit&#233;s-Etats grecques de Sicile, puis avec celles de la r&#233;publique romaine. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Le gouvernement de Carthage est une oligarchie, peu diff&#233;rente de celle de la Rome r&#233;publicaine. Un ou deux "sofet&#234;m" (dont la meilleure traduction pourrait &#234;tre "juge") sont &#233;lus tous les ans parmi les familles les plus riches et les plus influentes de Carthage pour occuper des fonctions ex&#233;cutives ou judiciaires. Ces familles aristocrates sont &#233;galement repr&#233;sent&#233;es dans un organe d&#233;lib&#233;rant sans doute similaire au S&#233;nat romain. Bien que Carthage soit essentiellement contr&#244;l&#233;e par ces oligarques, quelques rares &#233;lections sont n&#233;anmoins organis&#233;es pour des postes de moindre autorit&#233; dans le gouvernement. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]La prosp&#233;rit&#233; &#233;conomique de Carthage repose largement sur son commerce lucratif avec les mines d'argent et d'&#233;tain en Espagne ; ses routes commerciales sont jalousement gard&#233;es par les marchands carthaginois. Sur le plan culturel, les Carthaginois pratiquent la religion polyth&#233;iste des Ph&#233;niciens, reposant sur la v&#233;n&#233;ration du couple divin Tanit et Baal. Les Carthaginois semblent &#233;galement avoir particip&#233; &#224; la pratique controvers&#233;e du sacrifice d'enfant dans le cadre de leur pratique religieuse, m&#234;me si certains historiens contestent cette hypoth&#232;se. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Carthage est d'abord entr&#233;e en conflit militaire avec les Grecs pour obtenir le contr&#244;le de la Sicile, dont la situation strat&#233;gique aurait permis aux Carthaginois de contr&#244;ler l'acc&#232;s &#224; la M&#233;diterran&#233;e occidentale. Carthage a men&#233; trois guerres distinctes contre les colonies grecques de Sicile, mais toutes se sont achev&#233;es sans v&#233;ritable vainqueur. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Finalement, Rome occupe les colonies grecques du sud de l'Italie continentale, offrant &#224; Carthage la possibilit&#233; de conqu&#233;rir la majorit&#233; du territoire sicilien. Des tensions entre les deux Etats entra&#238;nent n&#233;anmoins rapidement la Premi&#232;re guerre punique (264-241 av. J.-C.) au cours de laquelle les Romains prennent une revanche sur leurs revers initiaux et construisent pour la premi&#232;re fois une flotte leur permettant de battre les Carthaginois lors de la bataille des Iles Aegates. Cette victoire permet &#224; Rome d'acqu&#233;rir la Sicile et les deux empires entrent alors dans une phase de paix fragile. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]La perte de la Sicile au profit des Romains est compens&#233;e, chez les Carthaginois, par une extension de leurs possessions en Espagne. Ils commencent par ailleurs &#224; pr&#233;parer un deuxi&#232;me conflit avec Rome. La faction guerri&#232;re est dirig&#233;e par la famille Barca, et notamment par celui dont le nom va bient&#244;t devenir c&#233;l&#232;bre, Hannibal. Alors qu'une querelle frontali&#232;re en Espagne a provoqu&#233; un incident entre les deux Etats, le s&#233;nat carthaginois d&#233;clare la guerre, qui n'est autre que la Deuxi&#232;me guerre punique (218-202 av. J.-C.). [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Pendant ce conflit, Hannibal est autoris&#233; &#224; mener la campagne en Italie. Il conduit ses nombreuses forces, qui comprennent des &#233;l&#233;phants de guerre, &#224; travers les Alpes et prend les Romains par surprise (cr&#233;ant par ailleurs l'une des histoires de guerre les plus durables de tous les temps). Hannibal affronte la principale arm&#233;e romaine au lac Trasim&#232;ne (217) et la bat s&#233;v&#232;rement. Malgr&#233; ce d&#233;sastre, les Romains r&#233;ussissent &#224; rassembler une arm&#233;e encore plus grande l'ann&#233;e suivante. Les deux forces s'affrontent &#224; Cannes et, usant de plusieurs habiles manoeuvres tactiques, Hannibal an&#233;antit une fois de plus les forces romaines. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Apr&#232;s ce terrible massacre, les Romains adoptent la strat&#233;gie d'usure de Fabius Maximus, refusant de mener bataille contre Hannibal. Ce dernier continue &#224; d&#233;vaster la campagne italienne pendant la d&#233;cennie suivante, mais il ne r&#233;ussit pas &#224; paralyser Rome par la guerre. Pendant ce temps, le g&#233;n&#233;ral romain Scipion attaque les possessions de Carthage en Espagne, obtenant le contr&#244;le int&#233;gral de la r&#233;gion en 206. Il m&#232;ne ensuite lui-m&#234;me une exp&#233;dition en Afrique et Hannibal est alors rappel&#233; d'Italie pour d&#233;fendre la ville de Carthage. Les deux armes s'affrontent lors de la bataille de Zama en 202 av. J.-C., Hannibal &#233;tant vaincu et Scipion se faisant appeler "l'Africain" pour c&#233;l&#233;brer sa victoire. Carthage est oblig&#233;e de solliciter la paix et Rome lui impose des conditions tr&#232;s dures. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Malgr&#233; la destruction engendr&#233;e par la Deuxi&#232;me guerre punique et les dures conditions de paix, Carthage retrouve rapidement sa puissance et reprend le contr&#244;le du commerce en M&#233;diterran&#233;e occidentale. Les Romains y voient alors une grande source d'inqui&#233;tude, n'ayant jamais oubli&#233; les dommages caus&#233;s en Italie par Hannibal lors de la pr&#233;c&#233;dente guerre. En 149 av. J.-C., Rome d&#233;clare une nouvelle fois la guerre &#224; Carthage, qui deviendra la Troisi&#232;me guerre punique, en se fondant sur des pr&#233;textes fallacieux. Les Carthaginois essaient de n&#233;gocier un accord de paix mais seule la destruction totale de la ville peut satisfaire les Romains. Apr&#232;s un long si&#232;ge, la cit&#233; tombe aux mains des Romains et ses habitants y sont massacr&#233;s ou vendus comme esclaves. La ville m&#234;me de Carthage est d&#233;mantel&#233;e pierre par pierre et compl&#232;tement d&#233;truite. Elle sera reconstruite par les Romains mais l'ancien Etat ph&#233;nicien ne se rel&#232;vera jamais. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]</French>
		<German>[H1]Karthago[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Karthago, ein antiker Stadtstaat in Nordafrika, wurde etwa 814 vor Christus von ph&#246;nizischen Siedlern aus Tyros in der N&#228;he der heutigen Stadt Tunis gegr&#252;ndet. Der &#220;berlieferung zufolge war die erste Herrscherin Karthagos eine K&#246;nigin namens Dido, die in mehreren bis heute &#252;berlieferten Legenden der Griechen und R&#246;mer Erw&#228;hnung findet. Neben der Tatsache, dass Karthago &#252;ber eine fortschrittliche Hafenanlage verf&#252;gte, war die Stadt insgesamt sehr g&#252;nstig gelegen, um ein auf dem Mittelmeerhandel basierendes Seefahrtsimperium begr&#252;nden zu k&#246;nnen. Im Zuge der weiteren Ausdehnung des Stadtgebietes von Karthago entstanden zahlreiche neue ph&#246;nizische Kolonien an der Nordk&#252;ste Afrikas. Die karthagischen Kaufleute dominierten den Handel im westlichen Mittelmeerraum und die Seefahrer des Stadtstaates sollen bis nach Gro&#223;britannien und Nigerien gereist sein. Als Karthago immer mehr Macht und Einfluss gewann, kam es zun&#228;chst zu Konflikten mit den ersten griechischen Kolonien auf Sizilien und sp&#228;ter auch mit der R&#246;mischen Republik. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]&#196;hnlich wie in der Republik Rom wurde auch in Karthago die Staatsform der Oligarchie praktiziert. Jedes Jahr wurden ein oder zwei "Sufeten" (zu Deutsch etwa Richter) aus den einflussreichen, wohlhabenden Familien Karthagos in staatsf&#252;hrende und gesetzgebende &#196;mter gew&#228;hlt. Diese aristokratischen Familien waren au&#223;erdem in einem beratenden Organ vertreten, das in etwa mit dem r&#246;mischen Senat vergleichbar war. Im Wesentlichen unterstand Karthago damit der Kontrolle der Oligarchen, zus&#228;tzlich wurden jedoch in geringem Ma&#223;e auch Wahlen f&#252;r die Besetzung einiger eher unbedeutender Regierungsposten abgehalten. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Der wirtschaftliche Aufstieg Karthagos basierte vorrangig auf dem lukrativen Handel mit der Ausbeute aus den Silber- und Zinnminen in Spanien und entsprechend sorgsam wurden die daf&#252;r genutzten Handelswege auch von den karthagischen Kaufleuten bewacht. In kultureller Hinsicht praktizierten die Karthager die polytheistische Religion der Ph&#246;nizier, die auf der Verehrung des G&#246;tterpaares Tanit und Ba'al gr&#252;ndete. Es gibt einige Hinweise, die darauf deuten, dass die Karthager im Rahmen ihrer religi&#246;sen Riten auch die grausame Opferung von Kindern durchgef&#252;hrt haben-diese Frage ist unter Historikern jedoch umstritten. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Ihren ersten milit&#228;rischen Konflikt trugen die Karthager mit den Griechen um die Vorherrschaft &#252;ber die Insel Sizilien aus, deren strategisch g&#252;nstige Lage den Karthagern den Zugang zum westlichen Mittelmeerraum erm&#246;glicht h&#228;tte. Karthago f&#252;hrte drei separate Kriege gegen die griechischen Kolonien auf Sizilien, die alle im Gro&#223;en und Ganzen in einem ergebnislosen Patt endeten. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Schlie&#223;lich besetzten die R&#246;mer die griechischen Kolonien im S&#252;den des italienischen Festlandes, wodurch Karthago die Gelegenheit erhielt, einen Gro&#223;teil Siziliens zu erobern. Die Spannung zwischen den beiden Staaten entlud sich bald darauf im Ersten Punischen Krieg (264-241 vor Christus), in dessen Verlauf sich die R&#246;mer von ihren anf&#228;nglichen R&#252;ckschl&#228;gen erholen konnten und erstmals eine Flotte aufstellten, mit der es ihnen gelang, die Karthager in der Schlacht bei den &#196;gatischen Inseln zu schlagen. Durch diesen Sieg errang das R&#246;mische Reich die Vorherrschaft &#252;ber Sizilien und die beiden Kriegsparteien schlossen einen instabilen Frieden. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Nach dem Verlust Siziliens an die R&#246;mer gingen die Karthager ersatzweise dazu &#252;ber, ihr Territorium in Spanien zu erweitern. Gleichzeitig begannen sie aber auch mit den Vorbereitungen f&#252;r einen zweiten Krieg gegen Rom. An der Spitze der karthagischen Kriegstreiber standen die Mitglieder der Familie Barkas, insbesondere auch der aufstrebende Feldherr Hannibal, der bald darauf Ber&#252;hmtheit erlangen sollte. Als ein Grenzstreit in Spanien f&#252;r Unstimmigkeiten zwischen den beiden L&#228;ndern sorgte, rief der karthagische Senat den Kriegszustand aus und begann damit den Zweiten Punischen Krieg (218-202 vor Christus). [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Hannibal, der den Befehl erhalten hatte, einen Feldzug gegen Rom zu f&#252;hren, &#252;berquerte mit seiner gewaltigen Streitmacht-inklusive Kriegselefanten-die Alpen und &#252;berrumpelte die R&#246;mer (dies war gleichzeitig die Geburtsstunde einer der best&#228;ndigsten Kriegsgeschichten aller Zeiten). Im Jahr 217 vor Christus traf er dann am Trasimenischen See auf das Hauptheer der R&#246;mer und besiegte es. Trotz dieser verheerenden Niederlage stellten die R&#246;mer im darauf folgenden Jahr ein sogar noch gr&#246;&#223;eres Heer auf. Diesmal trafen die beiden Streitm&#228;chte bei Cannae aufeinander und auch hier setzte Hannibal wieder eine Reihe brillanter taktischer Man&#246;ver ein, die es ihm erm&#246;glichten, die R&#246;mer erneut vernichtend zu schlagen. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Nach diesem grausigen Gemetzel wandten die R&#246;mer eine abwartende Verz&#246;gerungstaktik an und vermieden weitere direkte Konfrontationen mit Hannibal. Dieser fuhr seinerseits zwar in den n&#228;chsten zehn Jahren mit der Verw&#252;stung der italienischen Landstriche fort, schaffte es jedoch nicht, die R&#246;mer ganz aus dem Krieg zu dr&#228;ngen. In der Zwischenzeit griff der r&#246;mische Feldherr Scipio die karthagischen Besitzungen in Spanien an und brachte die Region schlie&#223;lich 206 vor Christus vollst&#228;ndig unter seine Kontrolle. Danach f&#252;hrte er seine Truppen pers&#246;nlich nach Afrika. Hannibal wurde daraufhin zur Verteidigung Karthagos aus Italien zur&#252;ckgerufen. Die beiden Widersacher trafen im Jahr 202 vor Christus in der Schlacht von Zama aufeinander: Hannibal wurde geschlagen und Scipio nahm zum Gedenken an seinen Sieg den Beinamen "Africanus" an. Karthago war nun gezwungen, den R&#246;mern ein Friedensangebot zu unterbreiten und die von Rom gestellten harten Bedingungen zu akzeptieren. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Trotz der harten Friedensbedingungen und der Zerst&#246;rungen, die der Zweite Punische Krieg mit sich brachte, konnte Karthago bald zu seiner alten St&#228;rke zur&#252;ckfinden und arbeitete erneut daran, eine Vormachtstellung bei den Handelsaktivit&#228;ten im westlichen Mittelmeerraum einzunehmen. Das versetzte die R&#246;mer, die nie vergessen hatten, welche Verluste Hannibal Italien im Verlauf des letzten Krieges zugef&#252;gt hatte, in Angst und Schrecken. Aus diesem Grund erfolgte im Jahr 149 vor Christus erneut eine Kriegserkl&#228;rung seitens des R&#246;mischen Reiches an Karthago-der Dritte Punische Krieg begann. W&#228;hrend die Karthager versuchten, eine Einigung auszuhandeln, hatten sich die R&#246;mer dieses Mal das erkl&#228;rte Ziel gesetzt, die Stadt Karthago vollst&#228;ndig zu zerst&#246;ren. Tats&#228;chlich fiel die Stadt schlie&#223;lich nach einer langen Belagerung und die Einwohner wurden entweder get&#246;tet oder in die Sklaverei verkauft. Karthago wurde Stein f&#252;r Stein abgetragen und restlos vernichtet. Sp&#228;ter wurde die Stadt von den R&#246;mern zwar wieder aufgebaut, doch der Glanz des fr&#252;heren ph&#246;nizischen Stadtstaates sollte nie wieder zum Vorschein kommen.

		<Italian>[H1]cartagine[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Cartagine era un'antica citt&#224;-stato dell'Africa settentrionale situata nei pressi dell'odierna Tunisi e fondata dai coloni fenici provenienti da Tiro all'incirca verso l'814 a.C.. Secondo la tradizione, la prima sovrana fu la regina Didone, di cui si fa menzione in numerose leggende greche e romane. Cartagine godeva di un porto eccellente e la posizione della citt&#224; era favorevole alla creazione e al mantenimento di un impero marittimo fondato sul commercio nel Mediterraneo. Col tempo, Cartagine si espanse, assumendo il controllo delle colonie fenicie sulla costa settentrionale dell'Africa. I mercanti cartaginesi dominavano i traffici del Mediterraneo occidentale. I marinai giunsero forse fino alle isole britanniche e alla Nigeria. L'ascesa del potere e dell'influenza di Cartagine la portarono prima al conflitto con le pi&#249; importanti citt&#224;-stato della Magna Grecia in Sicilia e poi con la Repubblica Romana. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]La forma di governo cartaginese era quella dell'oligarchia, non dissimile dal sistema repubblicano romano. Uno o due "soffet" (traducibili come "giudici") erano eletti ogni anno tra le famiglie pi&#249; ricche e potenti della citt&#224; e si occupavano di amministrare e giudicare. Le famiglie aristocratiche trovavano anche rappresentanza in un organo legislativo simile al Senato romano. Anche se i poteri principali appartenevano a questi oligarchi, v'era spazio per l'elezione di alcuni ufficiali minori. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]La prosperit&#224; economica di Cartagine si basava soprattutto sul commercio derivante dalle miniere d'argento e di stagno della Spagna. Le rotte commerciali erano sorvegliate gelosamente dai mercanti cartaginesi. A Cartagine si celebravano i riti di una religione politeista derivata da quella fenicia e che si basava sull'adorazione della coppia divina di Tanit e Ba'al. Sembrerebbe che essa comprendesse anche l'orribile sacrificio di bambini, anche se il punto &#232; controverso tra gli storici. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Cartagine entr&#242; in conflitto dapprima con i Greci per il controllo sulla Sicilia, la cui posizione strategica permetteva di avere il controllo sul Mediterraneo occidentale. Tre furono le guerre con le colonie greche in Sicilia e tutte si conclusero con un nulla di fatto. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]In seguito Roma occup&#242; le colonie greche dell'Italia meridionale, dando la possibilit&#224; a Cartagine di conquistare la Sicilia. La tensione tra i due stati si esacerb&#242; fino a dar vita alla Prima Guerra Punica (264-241 a.C.), durante la quale i Romani, ripresisi dalle sconfitte iniziali, costruirono la loro prima flotta, con cui riuscirono a sconfiggere i cartaginesi nello scontro delle isole Egadi. Con questa vittoria, i Romani conquistarono la Sicilia e tra i due stati venne siglata la pace non senza tensioni. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Dopo aver perduto la Sicilia, i Cartaginesi presero a espandersi in Spagna per compensare la perdita e inoltre cominciarono a prepararsi per un nuovo scontro con Roma. La fazione favorevole alla guerra era guidata dalla famiglia Barca e in particolare da quell'Annibale che di l&#236; a poco sarebbe diventato famoso. La Seconda Guerra Punica ebbe inizio in seguito alla dichiarazione di guerra da parte del Senato cartaginese per via di una disputa di confine in Spagna (218-202 a.C.). [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Nel corso del conflitto, Annibale fu autorizzato a condurre una campagna in Italia. Egli guid&#242; le sue forze (che contavano anche degli elefanti da guerra) attraversando le Alpi e prendendo i Romani alla sprovvista, dando vita a uno degli episodi di guerra pi&#249; famosi di sempre. Annibale si scontr&#242; col grosso dell'esercito romano presso il lago Trasimeno (217 a.C.), sconfiggendolo. Nonostante la batosta, i Romani si riorganizzarono e nell'anno seguente riuscirono a mettere insieme un esercito ancora pi&#249; numeroso del precedente. Le due fazioni si scontrarono a Canne dove, grazie a una serie di manovre tattiche ben studiate, Annibale riport&#242; un'altra vittoria schiacciante. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]In seguito a quel funesto massacro, i Romani adottarono la strategia attendista di Fabio, evitando lo scontro aperto con le truppe di Annibale. Questi continu&#242; a devastare la campagna italica per i dieci anni successivi, senza per&#242; riuscire a infliggere il colpo di grazia a Roma. Nel frattempo il generale romano Scipione attacc&#242; gli insediamenti cartaginesi in Spagna, conquistando il pieno controllo della regione nel 206. Scipione quindi condusse una spedizione in Africa, costringendo i Cartaginesi al richiamo delle truppe di Annibale. I due eserciti si scontrarono nella battaglia di Zama nel 202 a.C. e, sconfitto Annibale, Scipione assunse il nome de "l'Africano" per celebrare la vittoria. Cartagine fu costretta a firmare la resa con condizioni molto aspre imposte da parte dei Romani. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Nonostante le devastazioni dovute alla Seconda Guerra Punica e le aspre condizioni di pace, Cartagine recuper&#242; presto le sue forze e torn&#242; ad avere l'influenza di un tempo sul Mediterraneo, alimentando grandi timori nei Romani, che non avevano dimenticato l'esito della campagna di Annibale in Italia. Nel 149 a.C., Roma dichiar&#242; ancora una volta guerra a Cartagine con motivi pretestuosi, dando vita alla Terza Guerra Punica. I Cartaginesi cercarono di negoziare un accordo, ma l'unico obiettivo dei Romani era la distruzione definitiva della citt&#224;. Dopo un lungo assedio, la citt&#224; cadde: gli abitanti furono uccisi o venduti come schiavi, mentre la citt&#224; stessa venne abbattuta edificio per edificio. In seguito i Romani costruirono in quello stesso luogo un'altra citt&#224;, ma la colonia fenicia non risorse mai pi&#249;. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]</Italian>

Seg&#250;n la tradici&#243;n, su primer gobernante fue una reina llamada Dido, cuyo nombre se menciona en numerosas leyendas romanas y griegas que han llegado hasta nosotros. Cartago pose&#237;a un excelente puerto y contaba con una posici&#243;n privilegiada para formar un imperio mar&#237;timo basado en el comercio mediterr&#225;neo. Con el paso del tiempo y el desarrollo de su expansi&#243;n, Cartago se apoder&#243; de las dem&#225;s colonias fenicias del norte de &#193;frica. Los comerciantes cartagineses dominaban el comercio en el Mediterr&#225;neo occidental y es posible que llegasen a sitios tan remotos como Inglaterra o Nigeria. El aumento de su poder e influencia provocar&#237;a un conflicto, primero con las ciudades griegas de Sicilia y despu&#233;s con la rep&#250;blica de Roma. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]El gobierno de Cartago era una oligarqu&#237;a no muy diferente a la de Roma. Todos los a&#241;os se eleg&#237;a a uno o dos "sfetem" (t&#233;rmino que puede traducirse aproximadamente como "jueces") entre las familias ricas e influyentes de la ciudad, con grandes atribuciones ejecutivas y judiciales. Estas familias aristocr&#225;ticas contaban tambi&#233;n con representantes en un cuerpo deliberativo de caracter&#237;sticas similares a las del senado de Roma. Aunque Cartago estaba controlada por estos oligarcas, parece ser que hab&#237;a algunas elecciones limitadas para cubrir puestos de menor importancia en el seno del gobierno. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]La prosperidad de Cartago se basaba en gran medida a su lucrativo comercio con la plata y el esta&#241;o de Hispania, por lo que los mercaderes cartagineses guardaban celosamente las rutas comerciales a esta tierra. Desde el punto de vista cultural, los cartagineses practicaban el polite&#237;smo de los fenicios, basado en la veneraci&#243;n de la pareja de deidades Tanit y Baal. Seg&#250;n parece, practicaban la terrible costumbre de sacrificar ni&#241;os como parte de su religi&#243;n, aunque algunos historiadores no comparten esta tesis. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Cartago entr&#243; en conflicto con los griegos por la isla de Sicilia, cuya posici&#243;n estrat&#233;gica les hubiese permitido controlar el acceso al Mediterr&#225;neo occidental. Cartago libr&#243; tres guerras contra las colonias griegas de Sicilia, y todas terminaron sin un vencedor claro. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Finalmente, Roma ocup&#243; las colonias griegas del sur de Italia y permiti&#243; que Cartago conquistara la mayor parte de la isla. Las tensiones entre ambos estados no tardaron en provocar la Primera Guerra P&#250;nica (264-241 a. C.), en la que los romanos, tras reponerse de algunos reveses iniciales y construir una armada por vez primera, derrotaron a los cartagineses en la batalla de las islas Egadas. Esta victoria le proporcion&#243; a Roma la posesi&#243;n de Sicilia, y las dos potencias concertaron una paz dif&#237;cil. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Tras perder Sicilia a manos de los romanos, los cartagineses se desquitaron extendiendo sus posesiones ib&#233;ricas. Esto provocar&#237;a el segundo conflicto con Roma. La facci&#243;n m&#225;s belicosa estaba encabezada por la familia Barca, y especialmente por An&#237;bal, quien muy pronto alcanzar&#237;a gran renombre. Cuando una disputa fronteriza provoc&#243; un incidente entre los dos estados, el senado cartagin&#233;s declar&#243; la guerra, con lo que se inici&#243; la Segunda Guerra P&#250;nica (218-202 a. C.). [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Durante la guerra, An&#237;bal recibi&#243; permiso para invadir Italia. Condujo su gran ej&#233;rcito, que inclu&#237;a algunos elefantes, al otro lado de los Alpes, y as&#237; pill&#243; completamente por sorpresa a los romanos (y escribi&#243; una de las m&#225;s memorables p&#225;ginas de la historia b&#233;lica). An&#237;bal se encontr&#243; con el principal ej&#233;rcito romano y le infligi&#243; una sonora derrota en la batalla del lago Trasimeno (217 a. C.). A pesar del desastre, los romanos reunieron un ej&#233;rcito a&#250;n mayor al a&#241;o siguiente. Las dos fuerzas se encontraron en Cannas, donde, utilizando una serie de brillantes maniobras, An&#237;bal volvi&#243; a aniquilar a los romanos. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Tras esta espantosa derrota, los romanos emplearon la t&#225;ctica propuesta por Fabio de retirarse y no dar batalla a An&#237;bal. Este continu&#243; devastando la campi&#241;a italiana durante la d&#233;cada siguiente, pero fue incapaz de derrotar del todo a los romanos. Mientras tanto, el general romano Escipi&#243;n atacaba las posesiones cartaginesas en Espa&#241;a, cuya conquista culmin&#243; en el a&#241;o 206 a. C. Acto seguido, Escipi&#243;n dirigi&#243; una expedici&#243;n a &#193;frica y An&#237;bal tuvo que regresar para defender la ciudad de Cartago. Los dos bandos se encontraron en la batalla de Zama (202 a. C.). An&#237;bal fue derrotado y Escipi&#243;n adopt&#243; el sobrenombre de "el Africano" para conmemorar su triunfo. Cartago se vio obligada a pedir la paz y Roma le impuso t&#233;rminos muy severos. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]A pesar de la derrota en la Segunda Guerra P&#250;nica y de la dureza de las condiciones de paz, Cartago volvi&#243; a recuperarse y a ejercer su control sobre el comercio en el Mediterr&#225;neo occidental. Esto provoc&#243; el miedo de los romanos, que nunca hab&#237;an olvidado lo que An&#237;bal hab&#237;a hecho en Italia en la anterior guerra. En el a&#241;o 149 a. C., Roma declar&#243; la guerra a Cartago con falsos pretextos, lo que dio comienzo a la Tercera Guerra P&#250;nica. Los cartagineses trataron de llegar a un acuerdo, pero los romanos no buscaban ni m&#225;s ni menos que la destrucci&#243;n total de la ciudad. Tras un largo asedio, Cartago cay&#243; y sus ciudadanos fueron asesinados o reducidos a la esclavitud. La propia ciudad fue arrasada ladrillo a ladrillo. M&#225;s adelante ser&#237;a reconstruida por los romanos, pero el antiguo estado fenicio nunca volver&#237;a a aparecer. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]The Celts[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]The Celts were a group of Indo-Europeans who inhabited much of Central and Western Europe in the period between 1000 and 500 BC. While Celtic culture today is associated with Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the ancient Celts were spread out over a much larger distance. In addition to those locations, different groups of Celts were also present in Spain, France (Gaul), Hungary, and Bulgaria (Thrace). Although the Greeks and Romans considered the Celts to be barbarians, they possessed a sophisticated and unique culture. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The ancient Celts of Gaul and Britain (who we know the most about) were divided into many tribes loosely based on kinship ties. Social structure was determined by a mixture of class standing within the tribe and one's place within the Celtic religion. Kings were elected to lead the tribes, and society was divided into the three groups: warriors, an intellectual class of druids and bards, and everyone else. Society was based around warfare, but to the Celts it was more of a sport than a battle to the death: raids were the norm, and pitched battles were rare. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The Celts do not appear to have had any large cities, although there were many small towns and fortresses across the regions they controlled. Trade was rather primitive and mostly consisted of a barter economy, although in some coastal regions it was more developed. The Celts shared a common religion emphasizing sacred groves, the role of druids as priests and scholars, and the use of periodic sacrifices (which were occasionally human sacrifices). Celtic gods were named after natural phenomenon and they were quite numerous. Other Celtic practices included the removal of body hair (done to ensure cleanliness) and the taking of enemy heads as trophies in battle. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The most notable event in the early history of the Celts was the sacking of the city of Rome in 390 BC under the great King Brennus. Although the victory was a military triumph and provided a large immediate gain to the Celts, the Romans would prove to have a very long memory, and over the years they would make their enemies pay dearly for it by methodically conquering all Celtic territory their mighty legions could reach. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]By 192 BC, the Romans had subjugated the last of the Celtic tribes in Italy, and they then began a program of colonization of southern Gaul on the Mediterranean coast. Under the great general Julius Caesar, the Romans conquered the entirety of Gaul and defeated a large revolt headed by Vercingetorix between 58-51 BC, removing the Celtic threat to the Imperial City once and for all. Under the Emperor Claudius, the Romans went on to invade and occupy Celtic Britain as well. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The Celts remained under Roman rule for the next four centuries until the Germanic invasions of the fifth century AD destroyed the Roman Empire in the west. Although Celtic culture disappeared in many parts of Europe during those years of foreign occupation, it was preserved in Ireland and the western fringe of Britain. Over time the pagan Celtic culture would combine with Christianity to give rise to beautiful new forms of artwork and literature. Despite many attempts over the centuries to destroy it, the Celtic culture survives. In fact, today it enjoys a great deal of popularity and is even experiencing something of a revival.

		<French>[H1]Les Celtes[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Les Celtes sont un groupe d'Indo-europ&#233;ens habitant l'Europe centrale et occidentale entre 1000 et 500 av. J.-C. Alors que la culture celtique est aujourd'hui associ&#233;e &#224; l'Irlande, &#224; l'Ecosse et au Pays de Galles, les anciens Celtes occupaient un territoire bien plus &#233;tendu. En dehors de ces pays, on trouve aussi diff&#233;rents groupes de Celtes en Espagne, en France (la Gaule), en Hongrie et en Bulgarie (la Thrace). Les Grecs et les Romains consid&#232;rent les Celtes comme des barbares, mais ces derniers poss&#232;dent une culture complexe et unique. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Les anciens Celtes de Gaule et de Grande-Bretagne, que nous connaissons le mieux, sont r&#233;partis en nombreuses tribus vaguement li&#233;es par des liens de parent&#233;. La structure sociale est d&#233;termin&#233;e par une combinaison des positions occup&#233;es dans la tribu et dans la religion celte. Les rois sont &#233;lus pour diriger les tribus, et la soci&#233;t&#233; est divis&#233;e en trois groupes : les guerriers, une classe intellectuelle de druides et de bardes, et tous les autres. Cette soci&#233;t&#233; repose sur la guerre mais pour les Celtes, il s'agit plus d'un sport que d'un combat &#224; mort : les raids sont fr&#233;quents, contrairement aux batailles rang&#233;es. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Les Celtes ne semblent pas avoir d&#233;velopp&#233; de grandes villes, m&#234;me s'il existe de nombreuses petites villes et forteresses dans les r&#233;gions qu'ils contr&#244;lent. Le commerce est plut&#244;t limit&#233; et consiste essentiellement en une &#233;conomie de troc, m&#234;me si dans les r&#233;gions c&#244;ti&#232;res, il est plus d&#233;velopp&#233;. Les Celtes partagent une m&#234;me religion accordant beaucoup d'importance aux bosquets sacr&#233;s, au r&#244;le des druides comme pr&#234;tres et &#233;rudits ainsi qu'au recours aux sacrifices p&#233;riodiques (qui prennent parfois la forme de sacrifices humains). Les dieux celtiques portent les noms de ph&#233;nom&#232;nes naturels et sont relativement nombreux. D'autres pratiques celtiques consistent notamment &#224; &#233;piler l'int&#233;gralit&#233; du corps, ce qui garantit la propret&#233; ou encore &#224; rapporter les t&#234;tes des ennemis comme troph&#233;es lors des batailles. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]L'&#233;v&#233;nement le plus marquant au d&#233;but de l'histoire des Celtes est le pillage de la ville de Rome en 390 av. J.-C. sous la direction du grand roi Brennus. Cette victoire est un triomphe militaire et procure imm&#233;diatement un immense butin aux Celtes. Les Romains montreront cependant qu'ils ont bonne m&#233;moire et ils le feront payer ch&#232;rement &#224; leurs ennemis en conqu&#233;rant m&#233;thodiquement, au fil des ans, tous les territoires celtiques atteints par leurs puissantes l&#233;gions. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]En 192 av. J.-C., les Romains soumettent les derni&#232;res tribus celtiques en Italie et entament alors un programme de colonisation du sud de la Gaule, sur la c&#244;te m&#233;diterran&#233;enne. Sous la direction du grand g&#233;n&#233;ral Jules C&#233;sar, les Romains conqui&#232;rent l'int&#233;gralit&#233; de la Gaule et l'emportent face &#224; une importante r&#233;volte men&#233;e par Vercing&#233;torix entre 58 et 51 av. J.-C., faisant dispara&#238;tre une bonne fois pour toutes la menace celtique sur la ville imp&#233;riale. Sous le r&#232;gne de l'empereur Claude, les Romains poursuivent leurs invasions en occupant aussi la Grande-Bretagne celtique. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Les Celtes restent sous domination romaine pendant les quatre si&#232;cles suivants, jusqu'aux invasions germaniques du Ve si&#232;cle ap. J.-C. qui d&#233;truisent l'Empire romain &#224; l'ouest. Bien que la culture celtique ait disparu dans de nombreuses r&#233;gions d'Europe durant ces ann&#233;es d'occupation &#233;trang&#232;re, elle a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;serv&#233;e en Irlande et dans la partie occidentale de la Grande-Bretagne. Progressivement, la culture celtique pa&#239;enne s'est combin&#233;e avec le christianisme pour donner naissance &#224; de nouvelles formes d'art et de litt&#233;rature. Malgr&#233; de nombreuses tentatives de destruction au fil des si&#232;cles, la culture celtique demeure. De fait, elle est aujourd'hui tr&#232;s populaire et semble m&#234;me rena&#238;tre.

		<German>[H1]Die Kelten[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Die Kelten waren ein indo-europ&#228;isches Volk, das in der Zeit zwischen 1000 und 500 vor Christus gro&#223;e Teile Zentral- und Westeuropas besiedelte. W&#228;hrend die keltische Kultur heutzutage vornehmlich mit Irland, Schottland und Wales in Verbindung gebracht wird, waren die keltischen St&#228;mme in der Antike &#252;ber ein deutlich gr&#246;&#223;eres Gebiet verteilt: Neben den genannten Standorten hatten sich verschiedene Bev&#246;lkerungsgruppen der Kelten auch in Spanien, Frankreich (Gallien), Ungarn und Bulgarien (Thrakien) niedergelassen. Und obwohl sie von den Griechen und R&#246;mern als Barbaren betrachtet wurden, besa&#223;en sie doch eine einzigartige, ausgepr&#228;gte Kultur. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Die Kelten aus Gallien und Gro&#223;britannien (&#252;ber die am meisten bekannt ist) verteilten sich in der Antike auf viele verschiedene St&#228;mme, die durch verwandtschaftliche Bande lose miteinander verkn&#252;pft waren. Die gesellschaftliche Struktur ergab sich einerseits aus der Klassenzugeh&#246;rigkeit innerhalb des Stammes und andererseits aus der Position eines Stammesangeh&#246;rigen innerhalb der keltischen Religion. Jeder Stamm w&#228;hlte einen F&#252;rsten als Anf&#252;hrer, die Gesellschaft war in drei Schichten eingeteilt: die Krieger, die intellektuelle Kaste der Druiden und Barden und die "normalen" Stammesangeh&#246;rigen-also alle, die noch &#252;brig blieben. Grunds&#228;tzlich drehte sich das gesamte gesellschaftliche Leben um das K&#228;mpfen, wobei die Kunst der Kriegsf&#252;hrung bei den Kelten eher einem Sport gleichkam als tats&#228;chlich einer Auseinandersetzung auf Leben und Tod: "Hit and Run"-Angriffe waren f&#252;r die keltischen St&#228;mme die Norm, verbissene Stellungsk&#228;mpfe dagegen eher die Ausnahme. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Die Kelten scheinen keine gro&#223;en St&#228;dte unterhalten zu haben, aber sie siedelten mehrere kleinere D&#246;rfer und Festungen in den von ihnen kontrollierten Regionen an. Ihre Handelsaktivit&#228;ten waren eher einfacher Natur, meist wurde lediglich Tauschhandel betrieben, in einigen K&#252;stenregionen waren sie jedoch auch fortschrittlicher. Alle keltischen St&#228;mme teilten eine gemeinsame Religion, in deren Zentrum die geheiligten Haine, die Rolle der Druiden als Priester und Gelehrte und die zyklische Durchf&#252;hrung von Opferritualen standen (gelegentlich wurden auch Menschenopfer dargebracht). Die recht zahlreichen keltischen G&#246;tter waren nach Naturereignissen benannt. Zu den weiteren keltischen Ritualen geh&#246;rte die Entfernung der K&#246;rperbehaarung (um die eigene Reinheit zu gew&#228;hrleisten) und auch die Enthauptung ihrer geschlagenen Feinde, weil deren K&#246;pfe als Kampftroph&#228;en betrachtet wurden. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Das bemerkenswerteste Ereignis in der fr&#252;hen Geschichte der Kelten war die Eroberung Roms im Jahr 390 vor Christus unter der F&#252;hrung des gro&#223;en K&#246;nigs Brennus. Dieser Sieg stellte zwar definitiv einen milit&#228;rischen Triumph dar und verschaffte den Kelten unmittelbar enorme Vorteile, sp&#228;ter sollte sich jedoch herausstellen, dass die R&#246;mer &#228;u&#223;erst nachtragend waren: Im Laufe der darauf folgenden Jahre lie&#223;en sie ihre Feinde teuer f&#252;r ihren Sieg bezahlen, indem sie systematisch alle keltischen Gebiete eroberten, die ihre m&#228;chtigen Legionen erreichen konnten. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Bis 192 vor Christus hatten die R&#246;mer auch die letzten keltischen St&#228;mme in Italien unterworfen und begannen nun mit der Kolonisierung der Region S&#252;dgallien an der Mittelmeerk&#252;ste. Unter der F&#252;hrung des gro&#223;en Generals Julius C&#228;sar eroberten die R&#246;mer das gesamte gallische Gebiet und schlugen au&#223;erdem in der Zeit von 58 bis 51 vor Christus eine gro&#223;e, von Vercingetorix angef&#252;hrte Rebellion nieder, womit die durch die Kelten stets drohende Gefahr f&#252;r die Reichsstadt ein f&#252;r allemal ein Ende hatte. Sp&#228;ter, marschierten die R&#246;mer unter Kaiser Claudius in die keltischen Gebiete in Gro&#223;britannien ein und besetzten auch diese. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Nach diesen Ereignissen verbrachten die Kelten die n&#228;chsten 400 Jahre unter r&#246;mischer Herrschaft, bis das R&#246;mische Reich im Westen durch die Einm&#228;rsche der Germanen im 5. Jahrhundert nach Christus zerschlagen wurde. W&#228;hrend dieser langen Besatzungszeit ging die keltische Kultur in vielen Teilen Europas vollst&#228;ndig verloren, lediglich in Irland und den westlichen Randgebieten Gro&#223;britanniens blieb sie weiterhin erhalten. Im Laufe der Zeit vermischte sich die heidnische keltische Kultur mit der des Christentums und brachte in der Folge wundersch&#246;ne neue Varianten der Kunst und Literatur hervor. Trotz zahlreicher jahrhundertelanger Versuche, sie zu zerst&#246;ren, hat die keltische Kultur am Ende doch &#252;berdauert. Tats&#228;chlich erfreut sie sich heute gro&#223;er Popularit&#228;t und feiert gegenw&#228;rtig sogar so etwas wie eine Wiederauferstehung. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]</German>
		<Italian>[H1]I Celti[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]I Celti appartengono al ceppo indoeuropeo che nel periodo compreso tra il 1000 e il 500 a.C. occup&#242; buona parte dell'Europa centrale e occidentale. Anche se oggi la cultura celtica &#232; associata all'Irlanda, alla Scozia e al Galles, gli antichi Celti erano dunque sparsi su un territorio pi&#249; vasto, che ricomprendeva la Spagna, la Francia (Gallia), l'Ungheria e la Bulgaria (Tracia). Greci e Romani consideravano i Celti dei barbari, ma la loro cultura era in realt&#224; alquanto sofisticata. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Gli antichi Celti della Gallia e della Britannia (quelli che conosciamo meglio) erano divisi in trib&#249; legate da tenui rapporti di parentela. La struttura sociale teneva in considerazione le classi e la posizione di ciascuno all'interno della religione celtica. I re, che guidavano le trib&#249;, erano eletti. La societ&#224; era divisa in tre classi: i guerrieri, gli intellettuali (druidi e bardi) e gli altri. La societ&#224; teneva in gran conto la guerra, ma pi&#249; come sport che come scontro mortale: le incursioni erano frequenti, le battaglie campali rare. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]I Celti non costruirono mai grandi citt&#224;, ma controllavano numerosi villaggi e fortezze sparsi per il territorio. Il commercio era molto primitivo e si basava sul baratto, anche se in alcune regioni costiere era pi&#249; sviluppato. I Celti erano accomunati dalla religione, incentrata su boschi sacri, sul ruolo di druidi quali sacerdoti e sapienti e sulla periodicit&#224; di certi sacrifici (talvolta anche umani). Le divinit&#224; celtiche erano piuttosto numerose e prendevano il nome dai fenomeni naturali. Altre pratiche celtiche erano la rimozione dei peli (per motivi igienici) e la collezione delle teste degli avversari sconfitti in battaglia. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]L'evento pi&#249; famoso nella storia dei Celti fu il sacco di Roma, avvenuto nel 390 a.C. a opera del grande re Brenno. La vittoria fu un grande trionfo militare e assicur&#242; ai Celti un enorme bottino. I Romani per&#242; non dimenticarono lo scacco subito e negli anni seguenti la fecero pagare cara ai Celti, conquistando metodicamente tutti i territori celtici alla portata delle proprie potenti legioni. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Nel 192 a.C., i Romani avevano soggiogato le ultime trib&#249; celtiche in Italia e avviarono un programma di colonizzazione della Gallia meridionale e costiera. Il grande generale Giulio Cesare conquist&#242; l'intera Gallia e soffoc&#242; una rivolta guidata da Vercingetorige tra il 58 e il 51 a.C., cancellando la minaccia celtica nei confronti della citt&#224; imperiale una volta per tutte. Sotto l'imperatore Claudio, i Romani si spinsero fino a occupare la Britannia celtica. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]I Celti rimasero sotto il dominio romano per altri quattro secoli, finch&#233; le invasioni germaniche del quinto secolo d.C. causarono la caduta dell'Impero romano d'occidente. Durante quel periodo di occupazione romana la cultura celtica venne sradicata nella maggior parte dei territori, ma si preserv&#242; in Irlanda e nelle zone occidentali della Britannia. Col tempo la cultura pagana celtica si fuse con la cristianit&#224;, dando vita a meravigliose opere artistiche e letterarie. Nonostante i secoli di tentativi per cancellarla, la cultura celtica dunque &#232; sopravvissuta. Ancora oggi in effetti gode di una certa popolarit&#224; e che ha dato vita a una sorta di sua rifioritura. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Los celtas[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Los celtas eran un grupo de indoeuropeos que poblaban la mayor parte de la Europa occidental y central en el per&#237;odo comprendido entre el 1000 y el 500 a. C. Aunque hoy en d&#237;a asociamos la cultura celta con Irlanda, Escocia y Gales, los antiguos celtas cubr&#237;an un &#225;rea mucho m&#225;s extensa. Adem&#225;s de estas regiones, hab&#237;a diferentes grupos c&#233;lticos en Espa&#241;a, Francia (la Galia), Hungr&#237;a y Bulgaria (Tracia). A pesar de la opini&#243;n negativa de los griegos y los romanos, los celtas pose&#237;an una cultura sofisticada y original. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Los celtas de Galia y Britania (que son los que mejor hemos llegado a conocer) se divid&#237;an en muchas tribus unidas por vagos lazos de parentesco. La estructura social ven&#237;a determinada por la mezcla de la posici&#243;n personal en el seno de la tribu y el lugar ocupado en la religi&#243;n celta. Las tribus eleg&#237;an a sus reyes y la sociedad se divid&#237;a en tres grupos: guerreros, una clase intelectual de druidas y bardos, y luego todos los dem&#225;s. La sociedad se basaba en la guerra, que para los celtas era m&#225;s un deporte que una cuesti&#243;n de vida o muerte: las incursiones de saqueo, y no las batallas re&#241;idas, eran la norma. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Parece ser que los celtas no ten&#237;an grandes ciudades, pero en las regiones que controlaban hab&#237;a muchos pueblos y fortalezas. Su comercio era bastante primitivo y se basaba sobre todo en el trueque, aunque en algunas regiones costeras estaba m&#225;s desarrollado. Compart&#237;an una religi&#243;n com&#250;n centrada en las arboledas sagradas, el papel de los druidas como sacerdotes y eruditos y la realizaci&#243;n de sacrificios peri&#243;dicos (que a veces eran humanos). Los dioses c&#233;lticos, que se correspond&#237;an con los fen&#243;menos naturales, eran muy numerosos. Otras pr&#225;cticas de los celtas eran la depilaci&#243;n (por razones de higiene) y la decapitaci&#243;n de los enemigos ca&#237;dos en el campo de batalla. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]El acontecimiento m&#225;s importante de la historia de los celtas fue el saqueo de la ciudad de Roma en el a&#241;o 390 a. C., llevado a cabo bajo el mando del gran rey Brenno. Aunque la victoria fue un triunfo militar y proporcion&#243; grandes riquezas a los celtas, los romanos demostrar&#237;an tener una gran memoria a largo plazo y, con el paso de los a&#241;os, acabar&#237;an por hac&#233;rselo pagar conquistando de manera met&#243;dica todas las regiones c&#233;lticas que sus poderosas legiones lograron alcanzar. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]En el a&#241;o 192 a. C., una vez sojuzgada la &#250;ltima de las tribus celtas de Italia, los romanos emprendieron un programa de colonizaci&#243;n de la costa mediterr&#225;nea del sur de la Galia. Bajo el mando del gran general Julio C&#233;sar conquistaron la totalidad de la Galia y aplastaron la gran revuelta encabezada por Vercingetorix entre los a&#241;os 58-51 a. C., lo que supondr&#237;a el definitivo final de la amenaza celta para la ciudad imperial. Durante el reinado del emperador Claudio, los romanos invadieron y ocuparon tambi&#233;n la Britania celta. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Los celtas permanecieron bajo el dominio romano durante cuatro siglos, hasta que las invasiones germ&#225;nicas del siglo V d. C. destruyeran al Imperio Romano de occidente. Aunque su cultura desapareci&#243; en muchas partes de Europa durante estos a&#241;os de ocupaci&#243;n extranjera, sobrevivi&#243; en Irlanda y en la parte occidental de Inglaterra. Con el paso del tiempo, la cultura celta se fundir&#237;a con el cristianismo para dar a luz hermosas formas de arte y literatura. A pesar de las muchas y peligrosas pruebas que ha tenido que sobrellevar a lo largo de los siglos, ha logrado sobrevivir. De hecho, en nuestros d&#237;as disfruta de una gran popularidad e incluso est&#225; experimentando una especie de renacimiento. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]The Persians[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]The term Persia has been used for centuries, chiefly in the West, to designate a region of southern Iran formerly known as Persis or Parsa; the name of the Indo-European nomadic people who migrated into the region about 1000 BC, eventually supplanting the Assyrians and Chaldeans. The first mention of the Parsa occurs in the annals of Shalmanesar III, an Assyrian king, in 844 BC. Cyrus II (559-529 BC), also known as Cyrus the Great, was heir to a long line of ruling chiefs in Mesopotamia and was the founder of the Persian Empire; he was called the father of his people by the ancient Persians. In 550 BC, Cyrus, the Prince of Persia, revolted against the Median king Astyages and welded the Persians and Medes together into one powerful force. Cyrus consolidated his rule on the Iranian Plateau and then extended it westward across Asia Minor. In October 539 BC, Babylon, the greatest city of the ancient world, fell to his Persian forces. Cyrus also oversaw the construction of a series of great roads to link together the territories that he had conquered. Although Cyrus was a great military conqueror, he was also a fair ruler; he allowed the Jews to return from Babylon to their homeland in Palestine. His dynasty, known as the Achaemenids, ruled Persia for two centuries.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following the death of Cyrus' heir, Darius I (522-486 BC), a leading general and one of the princes of the Achaemenid family, proclaimed himself king following the suppression of a number of provincial rebellions and challenges from other pretenders to the throne. Darius was in the mold of Cyrus the Great-a powerful personality and a dynamic ruler. To consolidate his accession, Darius I founded his new capital of Parsa, known to the Greeks as Persepolis ("Persian City") and expanded the ranks of his personal bodyguard, the Immortals. The elite force drew its name from the fact that no matter how many men were lost, the Persian Emperor would always pay the cost to restore the Immortals back to their original strength. Although Darius consolidated and added to the conquests of his predecessors, it was as an administrator that he made his greatest contribution to Persian history. During his reign, political and legal reforms revitalized the provinces and ambitious projects were undertaken to promote imperial trade and commerce; coinage, weights and measures were standardized, and new land and sea routes explored and established. [PARAGRAPH:2]Such activities, however, did not prevent Darius from following an active expansionist policy. Campaigns in the east confirmed gains made by Cyrus the Great and added large sections of the northern Indian subcontinent to the list of Persian-controlled provinces. Expansion to the west began about 516 BC when Darius moved against the Greek colonies along the coast of Asia Minor. Xerxes (486-465 BC), son and successor of Darius I, was determined to continue the Persian conquest of the west and is best known for his massive invasion of Greece from across the Hellespont in 480 BC, a campaign marked by the battles of Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea. Although successful in the pacification of Egypt and suppression of a Babylon revolt, his defeat by the allied Greek city-states spelled the beginning of the decline of the Persian Empire. In Xerxes' last years, he squandered the once-enormous treasury he had gathered through trade and taxation by launching vast construction programs, most never finished. [PARAGRAPH:2]The death of Xerxes was the final turning point in Persian influence. Occasional flashes of vigor and ability by some of Xerxes' successors were too infrequent to prevent eventual collapse. The final act was played out during the reign of Darius III (336-330 BC), who was defeated at the Battle of Granicus (334 BC) by Alexander the Great. Persepolis fell to the young Macedonian conqueror in April 330 BC, and Darius, the last Achaemenid, was murdered in the summer of the same year while fleeing the Greek forces. In the struggle for power after Alexander's death, Seleucus I brought under his control the Persian provinces of Alexander's empire. But this unity was short-lived, as the Indian holdings successfully revolted and the Seleucid kingdom broke into the competing nations of Parthia and Bactria. Parts of the Seleucid kingdom lasted for two centuries, but it was eventually swept aside by the Parthians, who founded an empire that stretched almost as far as Persia under the Achaemenids. The Romans and Parthians struggled against one another for centuries over control of Mesopotamia, with the Parthians usually holding onto most of the Fertile Crescent. But in 224 AD the Parthians were themselves overthrown by a new Sassanid dynasty that revived many of the customs of the Achaemenids, such as the Zoroastrian religion. The Sassanids fought a series of debilitating wars with the Byzantine Empire in the 6th and 7th centuries, which fatally weakened the Persian Empire when the Arabs exploded onto the scene. In a series of decisive battles between 633 and 642, the Arabs conquered and destroyed the Persian Empire; since this time, Persia (modern Iran) has largely belonged to the Arab world. The customs and religion of ancient Persia were destroyed and the population absorbed into the surrounding Islamic culture; only a few remnants survive today.</English>
		<French>[H1]Les Perses[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Le terme Perse fut utilis&#233; pendant des si&#232;cles, notamment en Occident, pour d&#233;signer une r&#233;gion du sud de l'Iran, autrefois connue sous le nom de Persis ou Parsa. Il d&#233;signait alors le peuple nomade indo-europ&#233;en qui avait &#233;migr&#233; dans cette r&#233;gion vers 1000 av. J.-C., rempla&#231;ant les Assyriens et les Chald&#233;ens. La premi&#232;re mention de Parsa appara&#238;t dans les annales du roi assyrien Salmanasar III, en 844 av. J.-C. Cyrus II (559-529 av. J.-C.), &#233;galement connu sous l'appellation de Cyrus le Grand, est l'h&#233;ritier d'une longue lign&#233;e de chefs de M&#233;sopotamie et le fondateur de l'empire perse. A son &#233;poque, il est appel&#233; le p&#232;re de son peuple par les Perses. En 550 av. J.-C., Cyrus II, prince de Perse, se r&#233;volte contre le roi des M&#232;des, Astyage, et r&#233;unit les Perses et les M&#232;des sous son autorit&#233;. Il consolide sa domination du plateau iranien et l'&#233;tend vers l'Ouest, en Asie mineure. En octobre 539 av. J.-C., Babylone, la plus grande ville du monde antique, tombe aux mains de ses forces perses. Cyrus II supervise la construction de nombreuses grandes routes pour relier les territoires qu'il a conquis. Si Cyrus II est un grand conqu&#233;rant militaire, il est &#233;galement un dirigeant juste. Il permet aux juifs de quitter Babylone pour retourner dans leur patrie en Palestine. Sa dynastie, celle des Ach&#233;m&#233;nides, r&#232;gnera sur l'Iran pendant deux si&#232;cles.[PARAGRAPH:2]Apr&#232;s la mort de Darios Ier (522-486 av. J.-C.), h&#233;ritier de Cyrus II, l'un des principaux g&#233;n&#233;raux et des princes de la famille des Ach&#233;m&#233;nides se proclame roi, apr&#232;s avoir fait taire de nombreuses rebellions provinciales ainsi que les revendications d'autres pr&#233;tendants au tr&#244;ne. Darios Ier ressemble &#224; Cyrus le Grand : il est une forte personnalit&#233; et un dirigeant dynamique. Pour renforcer son accession au pouvoir, Darios Ier cr&#233;e la nouvelle capitale de Parsa, connue des Grecs sous le nom de Pers&#233;polis ("la ville des Perses") et &#233;largit les rangs de sa garde personnelle, les Immortels. Cette force d'&#233;lite tire son nom du fait que quel que soit le nombre d'hommes morts au combat, l'empereur perse paierait toujours le prix n&#233;cessaire pour que les Immortels retrouvent leur force d'origine. Certes, Darios Ier poursuit et &#233;largit les conqu&#234;tes de ses pr&#233;d&#233;cesseurs, mais c'est comme administrateur qu'il apporte sa plus grande contribution &#224; l'histoire perse. Durant son r&#232;gne, des r&#233;formes politiques et juridiques revitalisent les provinces et d'ambitieux projets sont entrepris pour promouvoir les &#233;changes imp&#233;riaux et le commerce : la monnaie, les poids et les mesures sont normalis&#233;s tandis que de nouvelles routes maritimes et terrestres sont d&#233;couvertes et &#233;tablies.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ces activit&#233;s n'emp&#234;chent pas pour autant Darios Ier de poursuivre une politique expansionniste active. Des campagnes men&#233;es vers l'Est confirment les annexions faites par Cyrus le Grand et ajoutent de grandes parties de l'est du sous-continent indien &#224; la liste des provinces contr&#244;l&#233;es par les Perses. L'expansion vers l'Ouest commence vers 516 av. J.-C., lorsque Darios Ier s'attaque aux colonies grecques des rivages d'Asie mineure. Xerx&#232;s (486-465 av. J.-C.), fils et successeur de Darios Ier, est d&#233;termin&#233; &#224; poursuivre la conqu&#234;te perse vers l'Ouest. Il est connu pour son invasion massive de la Gr&#232;ce par Hellespont en 480 av. J.-C., dont la campagne est marqu&#233;e par les batailles des Thermopyles, de Salamine et de Plat&#233;es. Malgr&#233; sa r&#233;ussite dans la pacification de l'Egypte et dans la r&#233;pression de la r&#233;volte de Babylone, sa d&#233;faite contre l'alliance des cit&#233;s-Etats grecques marque le d&#233;but du d&#233;clin de l'empire perse. Au cours des derni&#232;res ann&#233;es de sa vie, Xerx&#232;s dilapide l'&#233;norme tr&#233;sor qu'il avait r&#233;uni gr&#226;ce aux &#233;changes commerciaux et aux taxes, en lan&#231;ant de vastes programmes de construction qui ne seront jamais termin&#233;s.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sa mort marque la fin de l'influence perse. Des regains occasionnels de vigueur et de talent sous le r&#232;gne de certains successeurs de Xerx&#232;s ne seront pas suffisamment fr&#233;quents pour emp&#234;cher le d&#233;clin final. Le dernier acte se joue sous le r&#232;gne de Darios III (336-330 av. J.-C.), qui est d&#233;fait par Alexandre le Grand &#224; la bataille de Granique (334 av. J.-C.). Pers&#233;polis tombe alors aux mains du jeune conqu&#233;rant mac&#233;donien en avril 330 av. J.-C. et Darios III, le dernier Ach&#233;m&#233;nide, est assassin&#233; au cours de l'&#233;t&#233; de la m&#234;me ann&#233;e, alors qu'il fuit les forces grecques. Dans la lutte pour le pouvoir qui suit la mort d'Alexandre le Grand, S&#233;leucos Ier r&#233;ussit &#224; placer sous son contr&#244;le les provinces perses de l'empire d'Alexandre le Grand. Cette unit&#233; est toutefois &#233;ph&#233;m&#232;re : les possessions indiennes parviennent &#224; se r&#233;volter tandis que le royaume s&#233;leucide se divise entre les nations concurrentes de Parthie et Bactriane. Le royaume de S&#233;leucos Ier perdure dans certaines r&#233;gions pendant deux si&#232;cles pour finalement tomber aux mains des Parthes, qui fondent un empire s'&#233;tendant presque aussi loin que la Perse sous le r&#232;gne des Ach&#233;m&#233;nides. Les Romains et les Parthes luttent pendant des si&#232;cles pour le contr&#244;le de la M&#233;sopotamie, les Partes d&#233;tenant g&#233;n&#233;ralement la plus grande partie du Croissant fertile. En 224 ap. J.-C., les Parthes sont &#224; leur tour renvers&#233;s par la nouvelle dynastie des Sassanides qui ravive de nombreuses coutumes des Ach&#233;m&#233;nides, telles que la religion zoroastrienne. Les Sassanides sont affaiblis par les guerres qu'ils m&#232;nent contre l'empire byzantin aux VIe et VIIe si&#232;cles, et l'empire perse d&#233;cline irr&#233;m&#233;diablement lorsque les Arabes entrent en sc&#232;ne. Plusieurs batailles d&#233;cisives entre 633 et 642 permettent aux Arabes de conqu&#233;rir et de d&#233;truire l'empire perse. Depuis, la Perse (l'Iran moderne) appartient largement au monde arabe. Les coutumes et la religion de la Perse antique ont &#233;t&#233; oubli&#233;s et la population s'est adapt&#233;e &#224; la culture islamique environnante. Seuls quelques vestiges demeurent aujourd'hui.</French>
		<German>[H1]Die Perser[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Als Persien, auch Persis oder Parsa, wurde in der westlichen Welt Jahrhunderte lang eine Region im S&#252;diran bezeichnet. Die Perser, ein indoeurop&#228;isches Nomadenvolk, hatten sich um 1000 v.Chr. hier angesiedelt und letztlich die Assyrer und Chald&#228;er verdr&#228;ngt. Erste Erw&#228;hnung fand Parsa 844 v.Chr. in den Annalen des assyrischen K&#246;nigs Shalmanesar III. Der geachtete Monarch Kyrus II. der Gro&#223;e (559-529 v.Chr.), Spross eines alten mesopotamischen Herrschergeschlechts und Gr&#252;nder des Perserreichs, wurde von den Persern im Altertum als Vater seines Volkes bezeichnet. 550 v.Chr. erhob sich Kyrus gegen den Mederk&#246;nig Astyages und vereinte Meder und Perser unter seinem Banner zu einer m&#228;chtigen Streitmacht. Kyrus siedelte sich auf dem iranischen Plateau an, von wo er sein Hoheitsgebiet nach Kleinasien ausdehnte. Im Oktober 539 v.Chr. fiel Babylon, die gr&#246;&#223;te Stadt der antiken Welt, an die persischen Truppen. Gleichzeitig &#252;berwachte Kyrus den Bau verschiedener Stra&#223;en, die die L&#228;nder seines Reichs miteinander verbanden. Kyrus war ein brillanter Feldherr und ein gerechter Herrscher, der den Juden die R&#252;ckkehr aus dem babylonischen Exil in ihre Heimat Pal&#228;stina erm&#246;glichte. Seine Familie (die Achameniden) herrschte zwei Jahrhunderte lang &#252;ber Persien.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach dem Tod des Erben von Kyrus schlug Dareios I. (522-486 v.Chr.), ein Feldherr und Nachkomme der Achameniden, eine Reihe von Rebellionen in der Provinz nieder, schaffte andere Thronanw&#228;rter aus dem Weg und ernannte sich selbst zum K&#246;nig. In der Tradition von Kyrus II. entwickelte er sich zu einer einflussreichen Pers&#246;nlichkeit und einem gesch&#228;tzten, r&#252;hrigen Regenten. Um seine Stellung zu sichern, gr&#252;ndete Dareios I. eine neue Hauptstadt, von den Griechen Persepolis ("persische Stadt") genannt, und verst&#228;rkte seine Krumms&#228;bel-Truppen, die ihm zugleich als pers&#246;nliche Leibwachen dienten. Diese trugen den Ehrennamen "Unsterbliche", weil der Herrscher (unabh&#228;ngig von der Zahl der Verluste) stets darauf bedacht war, die urspr&#252;ngliche Kampfkraft dieser Eliteeinheit wiederherzustellen. Neben der Tatsache, dass Dareios erfolgreiche Eroberungsfeldz&#252;ge f&#252;hrte und sein Reich weiter ausdehnte, lag seine gr&#246;&#223;te St&#228;rke im administrativen und politischen Bereich. W&#228;hrend seiner Regentschaft f&#252;hrten politische und rechtliche Reformen zur Wiederbelebung der Provinzen. Es wurden ehrgeizige Projekte zur F&#246;rderung des imperialen Handels und der Wirtschaft realisiert, W&#228;hrungs-, Gewichts- und Ma&#223;einheiten standardisiert und neue Land- und Seewege erschlossen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Dar&#252;ber hinaus verfolgte Dareios aber auch eine aktive expansionistische Politik: Durch erfolgreiche Feldz&#252;ge im Osten best&#228;tigte er die persische Vormacht in den seinerzeit von Kyrus II. eroberten Gebieten und brachte au&#223;erdem gro&#223;e Regionen auf dem nordindischen Subkontinent als weitere Provinzen unter persische Kontrolle. Die Erweiterung des persischen Hoheitsgebiets in Richtung Westen begann um 516 v.Chr., als Dareios entlang der K&#252;ste Kleinasiens gegen die griechischen Kolonien zu Felde zog. Xerxes (486-465 v.Chr.), Sohn und Erbe von Dareios I., setzte den persischen Vormarsch in Richtung Westen fort. Ber&#252;hmt wurde er vor allem wegen seines Griechenlandfeldzugs im Jahre 480 v.Chr., dessen wichtigste Stationen die Schlachten bei den Thermopylen, bei Salamis und Plat&#228;&#228; waren. Die griechischen Stadtstaaten waren bereits bei der Pazifizierung von &#196;gypten und der Unterdr&#252;ckung einer babylonischen Revolte erfolgreich gewesen und schlossen sich nun zusammen, um Xerxes vernichtend zu schlagen und damit den Untergang des persischen Reichs einzuleiten. Angesichts der erlittenen Niederlagen entschloss sich der in seinem Stolz tief verletzte Xerxes schlie&#223;lich schweren Herzens zum R&#252;ckzug. Seine letzten Jahre widmete er der Vergeudung seines einst enormen, durch Handel und Steuern erworbenen Verm&#246;gens: Er initiierte riesige Bauprogramme, von denen die meisten jedoch nie vollendet wurden. [PARAGRAPH:2]Xerxes' Tod war der endg&#252;ltige Wendepunkt f&#252;r das Perserreich. Seinen Nachfolgern gelang es nur selten, den Kampfgeist fr&#252;herer Tage zu entflammen. Nachdem Dareios III (336-330 v.Chr.) in der Schlacht am Granicos (334 v.Chr.) von den Truppen Alexanders des Gro&#223;en vernichtend geschlagen worden war, fiel im April des Jahres 330 v.Chr. schlie&#223;lich auch Persepolis an den jungen makedonischen Eroberer. Dareios III., der letzte Vertreter der Achameniden, wurde im Sommer desselben Jahres auf der Flucht vor den griechischen Truppen ermordet. Nach dem Tode Alexanders des Gro&#223;en brachte Seleukos I. auch die persischen Provinzen unter die Kontrolle des alexandrinischen Kaiserreichs, diese Vereinigung war jedoch nur von kurzer Dauer, bis die indischen Stellungen erfolgreich revoltierten und das Seleukidenreich in die verfeindeten Volksst&#228;mme Parthien und Baktrien zerfiel. Teile des Seleukidenreichs bestanden noch etwa 2 Jahrhunderte, bis sie schlie&#223;lich von den Parthern unterworfen wurden. Diese begr&#252;ndeten ein Reich, das weite Teile des Achamenidenreichs umfasste. In den folgenden 100 Jahren k&#228;mpften R&#246;mer und Parther verbissen um die Vorherrschaft in Mesopotamien. Im Jahr 224 wurden die Parther schlie&#223;lich von einer neuen Sassaniden-Dynastie unterworfen, die viele Gebr&#228;uche der Achameniden (unter anderem auch die zoroastrische Religion) wieder einf&#252;hrten. Im 6. und 7. Jahrhundert f&#252;hrten die Sassaniden mehrere blutige Kriege gegen Byzanz, die das Perserreich nachhaltig schw&#228;chten und den pl&#246;tzlich erstarkten Arabern leichtes Spiel lie&#223;en. Zwischen 633 und 642 unterwarfen und zerst&#246;rten diese das ganze Perserreich. Seitdem ist Persien (der heutige Iran) Teil der arabischen Welt. Die Gebr&#228;uche und die Religion des antiken Persien wurden zerst&#246;rt. Heute sind die meisten Bewohner des Landes Muslime.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]I Persiani[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Il termine Persia &#232; stato usato per secoli, principalmente nell'Ovest, per indicare una regione dell'Iran meridionale, precedentemente conosciuta come Persis, o Parsa, il nome della civilt&#224; nomade indo-europea che migr&#242; nella regione intorno al 1000 a. C. prendendo il posto degli Assiri e dei Caldei. La prima menzione di Parsa compare negli annali di Shalmanesar III, un re Assiro, nell'844 a. C. Ciro II (559-529 a. C.), anche noto come Ciro il Grande, era l'erede di un'antica dinastia di capi della Mesopotamia e il fondatore dell'Impero Persiano. Fu chiamato padre della sua gente dagli antichi Persiani. Nel 550 a. C., Ciro, il Principe di Persia, si rivolt&#242; contro il re dei Medi, Astyages, e riun&#236; assieme in Persiani e i Medi, in un unico esercito. Ciro consolid&#242; il suo potere sull'altopiano Iranico e lo estese a ovest, in Asia Minore. Nell'ottobre del 539 a. C., Babilonia, la pi&#249; grande citt&#224; del mondo antico, cadde nelle mani delle truppe Persiane. Ciro intraprese anche la costruzione di una serie di lunghe strade che collegassero i territori conquistati. Sebbene fosse un grande conquistatore, era anche un governatore giusto: permise agli Ebrei di tornare dalla Babilonia alla Palestina, nella loro terra natale. La sua dinastia, nota come al dinastia degli Achemenidi, govern&#242; la Persia per due secoli.[PARAGRAPH:2]In seguito alla morte dell'erede di Ciro, Dario I (522-486 a. C.), un generale in carica, nonch&#233; uno dei principi della famiglia Achemenide, si proclam&#242; re, dopo aver soffocato parecchie ribellioni provinciali e sconfitto diversi pretendenti al trono. Dario emul&#242; la figura di Ciro il Grande: una personalit&#224; forte e un capo flessibile. Per consolidare la sua ascesa, Dario I fond&#242; la nuova capitale di Parsa, conosciuta dai Greci come Persepoli ("citt&#224; persiana") e aument&#242; i ranghi delle sue guardie personali, gli Immortali. Questa forza d'elite prendeva il proprio nome dal fatto che, qualsiasi fossero le perdite subite, tornava sempre alla propria forza originale per ordine dell'imperatore Persiano. Malgrado Dario avesse consolidato e ampliato le conquiste dei suoi predecessori, era il suo eccellere negli aspetti amministrativi che diede il maggiore contributo alla storia Persiana. Durante il suo regno, le riforme politiche e legali rivitalizzarono le province e furono attuati ambiziosi progetti per promuovere il commercio; si crearono degli standard per il conio delle monete, per pesi e misure, come pure furono esplorate rotte e create vie per terra e per mare.[PARAGRAPH:2]In ogni caso, queste attivit&#224; non impedirono a Dario di seguire una politica espansionista attiva. Le campagne a est consolidarono le conquiste di Ciro il Grande e aggiunsero ampie sezioni del subcontinente Indiano all'elenco delle province controllate dalla Persia. L'espansione a ovest inizi&#242; attorno al 516 a. C., quando Dario si diresse contro le colonie Greche lungo la costa dell'Asia Minore. Serse (486-465 a. C.), figlio e successore di Dario I, era determinato a continuare le conquiste persiane ad ovest ed &#232; meglio conosciuto per la sua campagna nell'Ellesponto contro i Greci, nel 480 a. C., caratterizzata dalle battaglie delle Termopili, di Salamina e di Platea. Malgrado il successo nella pacificazione dell'Egitto e nella soppressione di una rivolta Babilonese, la sconfitta subita da parte delle citt&#224;-stato greche, alleate fra di loro, provoc&#242; l'inizio del declino dell'Impero Persiano. Nei suoi ultimi anni, Serse dissip&#242; le enormi ricchezze che aveva accumulato mediante il commercio e la tassazione, lanciando grandi programmi di costruzione, la maggior parte dei quali non furono mai portati a termine.[PARAGRAPH:2]La morte di Serse fu la svolta decisiva per l'influenza Persiana. Gli occasionali sussulti di vigore e abilit&#224; di alcuni dei successori di Serse furono troppo sporadici per impedirne il crollo. L'ultimo atto avvenne durante il regno di Dario II (423-404 a. C), sconfitto nella battaglia del Granico (334 a. C.) contro Alessandro Magno. Persepoli venne sconfitta dal giovane conquistatore Macedone nell'aprile del 330 a. C. e Dario, l'ultimo degli Achemenidi, fu ucciso nell'estate dello stesso anno mentre fuggiva dalle truppe Greche. Nella lotta per il potere dopo la morte di Alessandro, Seleuco port&#242; sotto il suo controllo le province persiane dell'impero di Alessandro. Ma quest'unit&#224; ebbe vita breve e le province indiane si ribellarono con successo, mentre il regno dei Seleucidi si spacc&#242; fra le nazioni rivali di Partia e Battriana. Parte del regno Seleuco dur&#242; per altri due secoli, ma venne infine spazzato via dai Partiani, che fondarono un impero in grado di rivaleggiare con la Persia degli Achemenidi. I Romani e i Partiani lottarono per secoli per il controllo della Mesopotamia e furono questi ultimi a detenerne il controllo per la maggior parte del tempo. Nel 224 d. C., i Partiani vennero rovesciati da una nuova dinastia Sassanide, che ripristin&#242; molte delle usanze degli Achemenidi, come la religione Zoroastriana. Nel VI e VII secolo, i Sassanidi combatterono una serie di guerre contro l'Impero Bizantino, uscendone fatalmente indeboliti proprio nel periodo in cui gli Arabi cominciavano a invadere la scena. In una serie di battaglie decisive tra il 633 e il 642, gli Arabi conquistarono e distrussero l'Impero Persiano. Da allora, la Persia (il moderno Iran) appartiene in gran parte al mondo Arabo.

Aunque Ciro fue un gran conquistador, tambi&#233;n fue un gobernante justo; permiti&#243; que los jud&#237;os regresaran a su patria, Palestina, desde Babilonia. Su dinast&#237;a, conocida como aquem&#233;nida, gobern&#243; Persia durante dos siglos.[PARAGRAPH:2]A la muerte del heredero de Ciro, Dar&#237;o I (522-486 a. C.), destacado general y uno de los pr&#237;ncipes de la familia aquem&#233;nida, se proclam&#243; rey tras sofocar varias rebeliones provinciales y acabar con las aspiraciones de otros pretendientes al trono. Dar&#237;o estaba cortado por el mismo patr&#243;n que Ciro el Grande: contaba con una fuerte personalidad y era un regente din&#225;mico. Tras su advenimiento, fund&#243; su nueva capital, Parsa, a la que los griegos llamaban Pers&#233;polis (?ciudad persa?) y ampli&#243; las filas de su guardia personal, los inmortales. Este cuerpo de elite recib&#237;a su nombre del hecho de que, por muchos hombres que se perdieran, el emperador persa siempre restablec&#237;a el refuerzo de los Inmortales hasta su n&#250;mero original. Aunque Dar&#237;o consolid&#243; las conquistas de sus predecesores y las aument&#243;, su principal contribuci&#243;n a la historia persa la hizo en calidad de administrador. Durante su reinado, una serie de reformas pol&#237;ticas y legales revitalizaron las provincias y se emprendieron proyectos ambiciosos para fomentar la industria y el comercio imperiales; se normalizaron las monedas y los pesos y medidas, y se abrieron y consolidaron nuevas rutas mar&#237;timas. [PARAGRAPH:2]No obstante, dichas actividades no impidieron que Dar&#237;o siguiese una activa pol&#237;tica expansionista. Las campa&#241;as en el este consolidaron las conquistas realizadas por Ciro el Grande y a&#241;adieron grandes regiones del norte del subcontinente indio a la lista de provincias controladas por los persas. La expansi&#243;n hacia el oeste comenz&#243; alrededor del a&#241;o 516 a. C. cuando Dar&#237;o atac&#243; las colonias griegas de la costa de Asia Menor. Jerjes (486-465 a. C.), hijo y sucesor de Dar&#237;o I, estaba decidido a proseguir la conquista persa del oeste y es c&#233;lebre por su invasi&#243;n a gran escala de Grecia a trav&#233;s del Helesponto en el 480 a. C., una campa&#241;a marcada por las batallas de las Term&#243;pilas, Salamina y Platea. Aunque logr&#243; la pacificaci&#243;n de Egipto y sofoc&#243; una revuelta en Babilonia, su derrota a manos de la alianza de las cuidades-estado griegas marc&#243; el inicio del declive del imperio persa. En sus &#250;ltimos a&#241;os, Jerjes despilfarr&#243; el tesoro, anta&#241;o ingente, que hab&#237;a amasado gracias al comercio y los impuestos iniciando enormes programas de construcci&#243;n, en su mayor parte inacabados. [PARAGRAPH:2]La muerte de Jerjes fue el punto de inflexi&#243;n final en la influencia persa. Las muestras ocasionales de vigor y capacidad dadas por los sucesores de Jerjes fueron demasiado infrecuentes como para impedir su colapso final. El &#250;ltimo acto se desarroll&#243; durante el reinado de Dar&#237;o III (336-330 a. C.), derrotado en la batalla de Granico (334 d. C.) por Alejandro Magno. Pers&#233;polis cay&#243; ante el joven conquistador macedonio en abril del a&#241;o 330 a. C., y Dar&#237;o, el &#250;ltimo aquem&#233;nida, fue asesinado en el verano de ese mismo a&#241;o mientras hu&#237;a de los ej&#233;rcitos griegos. En la lucha por el poder tras la muerte de Alejandro, Seleuco I se apoder&#243; de las provincias persas del imperio de Alejandro. Pero esta unidad fue ef&#237;mera, ya que los territorios indios lograron rebelarse y el reino sel&#233;ucida se dividi&#243; en las naciones rivales de Partia y Bactria. Una parte del reino sel&#233;ucida sobrevivi&#243; dos siglos, pero finalmente fue absorbida por los partos, fundadores de un imperio que se extendi&#243; casi hasta los mismos l&#237;mites del imperio aquem&#233;nida. Los romanos y los partos se disputaron durante siglos el control de Mesopotamia, aunque lo normal es que la mayor parte del Creciente F&#233;rtil estuviera en manos de estos &#250;ltimos. Pero, en el a&#241;o 224 d. C., los partos fueron derrotados por una nueva dinast&#237;a, los sas&#225;nidas, que revivieron muchas de las costumbres de los aquem&#233;nidas, como la religi&#243;n zoroastrana. Los sas&#225;nidas libraron una serie de costosas guerras con el imperio bizantino a lo largo de los siglos VI y VII, que dejar&#237;an al imperio persa fatalmente debilitado cuando la aparici&#243;n de los &#225;rabes transform&#243; la situaci&#243;n. En una serie de batallas decisivas libradas entre 633 y 642, los &#225;rabes conquistaron y destruyeron el Imperio Persa; desde entonces, Persia (el moderno Ir&#225;n) ha pertenecido al mundo &#225;rabe. Las costumbres y la religi&#243;n de la Persia antigua fueron destruidas y la poblaci&#243;n absorbida por la cultura isl&#225;mica que la rodeaba; en la actualidad solo se conservan algunos vestigios.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]Rome[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]The founding of Rome on the fertile Tibur River is obscured by myth and legend, but it is generally accepted that Rome was first settled in 753 BC and that the Republic was founded in 509 BC, following the overthrow of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last of Rome's seven kings. Rome was built on a site highly prized by the Etruscans, who dominated the Italian peninsula in the 6th century BC. The Etruscan king Porsenna defeated the Romans and expelled Tarquinius Superbus. Yet before Porsenna could establish himself as monarch over the unruly Romans, he was forced to withdraw. Rather than restoring their inept king, the citizens replaced the monarchy with two elected consuls, generals whose primary task it was to lead Rome's armies, and a Senate to serve as an advisory body. Where the Etruscans had failed, the people of Rome succeeded in the task of unifying the various Italian peoples into a political whole.[PARAGRAPH:2]Toward the end of the 5th century BC, the Romans, propelled by the pressures of unchecked population growth, began to expand at the expense of nearby city-states. Rome's first two wars were fought with Fidenae, an independent city near Rome, and against Veii, an important Etruscan city. In the process, the expanding Roman Republic found the Greek phalanx formation too unwieldy for fragmented fighting in the hills and valleys of central Italy; accordingly, Rome evolved a new tactical system based on flexible ranks of cohorts, organized into self-contained Legions, the means by which Imperial Rome conquered and ruled the ancient world. As Rome became increasingly powerful, the remaining city-states took up arms; the ensuing Latin War (340-338 BC) was quickly decided in Rome's favor. By 264 BC all Italy south of the Alps was united under the leadership of Rome, its members either incorporated in or allied with the Republic. Rome's growing influence led it into conflict with Carthage, an established commercial power in northern Africa. The defeat and destruction of Carthage in the three Punic Wars (264-146 BC) sustained Rome's acquisitive momentum, and the Republic set its sights on dominating the entire Mediterranean area. In short order, the Romans overran Syria, Macedonia, Greece, and Egypt, all of which had until then been part of the decaying Hellenistic empire created by Alexander the Great.[PARAGRAPH:2]But such expansion was not without costs; tensions grew and civil war erupted. The ensuing period of unrest and revolution marked the transition of Rome from a republic to an empire. The Late Republic witnessed the struggle between Marius and Sulla, the famous slave uprising under Spartacus, and saw the rise of figures such as the general Pompey, the orator Cicero, and the consul Julius Caesar. Although he was dismissed as vain and effeminate young man early in his career, Caesar proved to be a master politician and military strategist. Caesar conquered Gaul between 58-50 BC, then proceeded to crush all of his opponents in a civil war that left him the undisputed master of Rome. After Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, it was not long before civil war again erupted; but following his victory at Actium (31 BC), Octavian, Caesar's nephew, was crowned Rome's first emperor, taking the name Augustus (27 BC-14 AD).[PARAGRAPH:2]Although there were notable exceptions such as Caligula (37-41) and Nero (54-68), the Roman Empire was generally blessed with a series of able and brilliant leaders during its first two centuries who expanded the frontiers until Rome's empire reached from Britain to Egypt and from Spain to Persia. Imperial Rome was distinguished not only for its military-the foundation upon which the empire rested-but also for its accomplishments in engineering and statecraft. The Romans were gifted in the applied arts of law, record-keeping and city planning, yet they also acknowledged and adopted the contributions of earlier peoples-most notably, those of the Greeks, much of whose culture was thereby preserved. Roman law was a complex body of precedents and opinions, which were finally codified in the 6th century as the Justinian Code. The empire's road network was without match in the ancient world, designed for rapid movement of commerce, agriculture, and mail delivery as well as the needs of the army. Roman city planners achieved unprecedented standards of hygiene with their plumbing, sewage disposal, dams, and aqueducts. Roman art and architecture, though often imitative of Greek styles, was boldly planned and lavishly executed. Roman science and culture, in short, became the foundations of the European world.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the death of the emperor Marcus Aurelius in 180 AD, the empire was plagued by a series of poor rulers. The Praetorian Guard, formerly a highly respected elite unit sworn to serve the emperor, turned into a body that would sell itself to the highest bidder. During the middle of the 3rd century, Rome suffered through more than 30 emperors in a span of 70 years, and the empire nearly collapsed under the pressure of internal revolts and barbarian invaders. The Emperor Diocletian (284-305) managed to restore order, at the cost of imposing a strict authoritarian rule that left little room for individual freedom. Further chaos broke out after Diocletian's retirement, until Constantine (306-337) managed to emerge victorius from another series of civil wars. Constantine accomplished two extremely noteworthy things; first, he founded the city of Constantinople to serve as the new capital of the empire, from which the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire would endure for another thousand years. Secondly, Constantine legalized Christianity as a religion, allowing it to spread much more rapidly throughout the Roman world.[PARAGRAPH:2]After Constantine's death, the empire was split into an eastern and western half, the division becoming permanent in 395. When the empire again came under barbarian onslaught in the late 4th and 5th centuries, the weakened West collapsed but the East-where most of the empire's population and wealth was concentrated-managed to survive. The final emperor of the west, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed in 476, although the Western Empire had become a fiction in all but name decades earlier. Although destroyed as a political entity, the Latin culture of the Roman Empire largely survived and can still be observed today throughout the Mediterranean.</English>

J.-C., et que la R&#233;publique remonte &#224; 509 av. J.-C., apr&#232;s le renversement de Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin le Superbe), le dernier des sept rois de Rome. Rome est construite sur un site tr&#232;s pris&#233; des Etrusques, qui dominent la p&#233;ninsule italienne au VIe si&#232;cle av. J.-C. Le roi &#233;trusque Porsenna bat les Romains et chasse Tarquinius Superbus. Cependant, avant que Porsenna ne puisse se d&#233;signer comme le monarque des Romains rebelles, il est oblig&#233; de se retirer. Au lieu de r&#233;tablir leur roi incomp&#233;tent, les citoyens remplacent la monarchie par deux consuls &#233;lus, qui sont des g&#233;n&#233;raux dont la t&#226;che principale consiste &#224; commander les arm&#233;es de Rome, et par un S&#233;nat servant d'organisme consultatif. L&#224; o&#249; les Etrusques ont &#233;chou&#233;, le peuple de Rome r&#233;ussit, parvenant &#224; unifier les diff&#233;rents peuples italiens dans un m&#234;me ensemble politique.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vers la fin du Ve si&#232;cle av. J.-C., les Romains, sous la pression de la croissance incontr&#244;l&#233;e de la population, commencent &#224; s'&#233;tendre sur le territoire des cit&#233;s-Etats voisines. Rome m&#232;ne ses deux premi&#232;res guerres contre Fid&#232;nes, une cit&#233; ind&#233;pendante &#224; proximit&#233; de Rome, et contre V&#233;ies, une importante cit&#233; &#233;trusque. Au cours de ces campagnes, la R&#233;publique romaine, en pleine expansion, consid&#232;re que la formation grecque en phalange n'est pas adapt&#233;e aux combats dispers&#233;s dans les collines et vall&#233;es du centre de l'Italie. Rome &#233;volue donc vers un nouveau syst&#232;me tactique reposant sur des lignes flexibles de cohortes organis&#233;es en L&#233;gions autonomes, ce qui permet &#224; la Rome imp&#233;riale de conqu&#233;rir et de r&#233;gner sur le monde antique. Rome acqu&#233;rant de plus en plus de pouvoir, les cit&#233;s-Etats restantes prennent les armes et se lancent dans la Guerre latine (340-338 av. J.-C.) qui tourne rapidement en faveur de Rome. En 264 av. J.-C., toute l'Italie situ&#233;e au sud des Alpes est unifi&#233;e sous le contr&#244;le de Rome, les statuts des diverses r&#233;gions allant de l'int&#233;gration &#224; l'alliance avec la R&#233;publique. L'influence croissante de Rome l'am&#232;ne &#224; entrer en conflit avec Carthage, une puissance commerciale bien &#233;tablie d'Afrique du Nord. La d&#233;faite et la destruction de cette ville au cours des trois guerres puniques (264-146 av. J.-C.) conforte l'&#233;lan de conqu&#234;te de Rome, et la R&#233;publique envisage de dominer toute la zone m&#233;diterran&#233;enne. Rapidement, les Romains envahissent la Syrie, la Mac&#233;doine, la Gr&#232;ce et l'Egypte qui appartenaient toutes &#224; l'empire hell&#233;nique d&#233;cadent cr&#233;&#233; par Alexandre le Grand.[PARAGRAPH:2]Le co&#251;t d'une telle expansion n'est toutefois pas nul : des tensions apparaissent et une guerre civile se d&#233;clenche. La p&#233;riode de troubles et de r&#233;volution qui suit marque une transition, la R&#233;publique de Rome devenant un empire. A la fin de la R&#233;publique, on assiste &#224; la lutte entre Marius et Sulla, &#224; la c&#233;l&#232;bre r&#233;volte d'esclaves sous la direction de Spartacus et &#224; l'ascension de grands noms tels que le g&#233;n&#233;ral Pomp&#233;e, l'orateur Cic&#233;ron et le consul Jules C&#233;sar. Consid&#233;r&#233; comme un jeune homme vaniteux et eff&#233;min&#233; au d&#233;but de sa carri&#232;re, C&#233;sar s'av&#232;re un politicien et un strat&#232;ge militaire talentueux. Il conquiert la Gaule entre 58 et 50 av. J.-C., puis entra&#238;ne tous ses opposants dans une guerre civile dont il ressort comme le ma&#238;tre incontest&#233; de Rome. Apr&#232;s l'assassinat de C&#233;sar en 44 av. J.-C., la guerre civile reprend rapidement. La victoire d'Octave, le neveu de C&#233;sar, &#224; Actium (31 av. J.-C.), lui permet d'&#234;tre couronn&#233; premier empereur de Rome. Il r&#232;gnera alors sous le nom d'Auguste (27 av. J.-C.-14 ap. J.-C.).[PARAGRAPH:2]Malgr&#233; quelques exceptions telles Caligula (37-41) et N&#233;ron (54-68), Rome se voit dirig&#233;e, durant ses deux premiers si&#232;cles d'existence, par plusieurs hommes talentueux et brillants qui &#233;tendent les fronti&#232;res de l'Empire romain jusqu'en Grande-Bretagne et en Egypte, en passant par l'Espagne et la Perse. La Rome imp&#233;riale ne se distingue pas uniquement par son organisation militaire, qui constitue la base de l'empire, mais aussi par ses talents en mati&#232;re d'ing&#233;nierie et de gestion des affaires publiques. Les Romains sont &#233;galement dou&#233;s pour l'application du droit, l'archivage et l'urbanisme, m&#234;me s'ils reconnaissent et adoptent par ailleurs les contributions des peuples pr&#233;c&#233;dents, et plus particuli&#232;rement celles des Grecs, ce qui permet de conserver leur culture. Le droit romain repose sur un ensemble complexe de pr&#233;c&#233;dents et d'opinions qui sont rassembl&#233;s au VIe si&#232;cle dans le Code Justinien. Le r&#233;seau routier de l'empire ne souffre aucune comparaison avec le monde antique. Il est con&#231;u pour am&#233;liorer les &#233;changes commerciaux et agricoles ainsi que la distribution du courrier et pour r&#233;pondre aux besoins de l'arm&#233;e. Les urbanismes romains permettent l'introduction de normes d'hygi&#232;ne in&#233;gal&#233;es gr&#226;ce &#224; la plomberie, aux barrages, aux aqueducs et &#224; des syst&#232;mes d'&#233;gouts. Les r&#233;alisations artistiques et architecturales des Romains, m&#234;me si elles imitent souvent les styles grecs, sont soigneusement planifi&#233;es et somptueusement ex&#233;cut&#233;es. La science et la culture romaines deviennent rapidement les fondements du monde europ&#233;en.[PARAGRAPH:2]A la mort de l'empereur Marc Aur&#232;le, en 180 ap. J.-C., l'empire est dirig&#233; par plusieurs dirigeants peu comp&#233;tents. La garde pr&#233;torienne, une unit&#233; d'&#233;lite tr&#232;s respect&#233;e ayant pr&#234;t&#233; serment pour servir l'empereur, se transforme en une institution se vendant au plus offrant. Au milieu du IIIe si&#232;cle, Rome conna&#238;t plus de 30 empereurs en moins de 70 ans et l'empire manque de s'effondrer sous la pression des r&#233;voltes internes et des envahisseurs barbares. L'empereur Diocl&#233;tien (284-305) parvient &#224; restaurer l'ordre, au prix d'une gestion stricte et autoritaire laissant peu de place &#224; la libert&#233; individuelle. Le chaos &#233;clate lorsque Diocl&#233;tien se retire, jusqu'&#224; ce que Constantin Ier (306-337) parvienne &#224; l'emporter apr&#232;s plusieurs autres guerres civiles. Deux de ses d&#233;cisions auront des cons&#233;quences cruciales. D'une part, il fonde la ville de Constantinople, qui servira de nouvelle capitale &#224; l'empire et o&#249; perdurera mille ans encore l'Empire byzantin, c'est-&#224;-dire l'Empire romain d'Orient. D'autre part, Constantin l&#233;galise le christianisme comme religion, lui permettant alors de se r&#233;pandre bien plus rapidement dans tout le monde romain.[PARAGRAPH:2]A la mort de Constantin, l'empire est divis&#233; en deux parties, l'une occidentale et l'autre orientale, la division devenant permanente en 395. Lorsque l'empire est &#224; nouveau attaqu&#233; par des barbares &#224; la fin du IVe si&#232;cle et au Ve si&#232;cle, l'Occident affaibli s'effondre mais l'Orient, o&#249; se concentrent la majorit&#233; de la population et des richesses de l'empire, parvient &#224; survivre. Le dernier empereur d'Occident, Romulus Augustule, est destitu&#233; en 476. Si l'entit&#233; politique est d&#233;truite, la culture latine de l'Empire romain survit en grande partie, comme on peut aujourd'hui encore l'observer sur tout le pourtour m&#233;diterran&#233;en.</French>
		<German>[H1]Rom[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Um die Entstehung Roms am fruchtbaren Ufer des Tibers ranken sich zahlreiche Mythen und Legenden. Fest steht jedoch, dass Teile der heutigen Stadt Rom bereits 735 v.Chr. gegr&#252;ndet wurden, w&#228;hrend die Republik Rom erst 509 v.Chr. nach dem Sturz von Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, dem letzten der sieben K&#246;nige Roms, entstand. Sie wurde an einem von den Etruskern gew&#228;hlten Standort erbaut, die im 6. Jh. v.Chr. den gr&#246;&#223;ten Bev&#246;lkerungsanteil der italienischen Halbinsel ausmachten. Ihr K&#246;nig Porsenna hatte die R&#246;mer besiegt und Tarquinius Superbus vertrieben, doch noch bevor er den Thron besteigen konnte, zwang ihn das widerspenstige Volk schon wieder zum R&#252;ckzug. Ihren eigenen vertriebenen K&#246;nig und damit die Monarchie ersetzten die B&#252;rger nun durch zwei gew&#228;hlte Konsuln-Milit&#228;rf&#252;hrer der r&#246;mischen Streitkr&#228;fte-sowie einen Senat, der ihnen als beratendes Organ zur Seite stand. Damit hatte das Volk aus eigener Kraft die diversen italienischen Volksgruppen zu einem politischen Ganzen vereint-was den Etruskern nie gelungen war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Wegen des Bev&#246;lkerungswachstums mussten die R&#246;mer ihr Reich gegen Ende des 5. Jh. v.Chr. vergr&#246;&#223;ern-auf Kosten der benachbarten Stadtstaaten. Die ersten beiden Eroberungskriege f&#252;hrten sie gegen die unabh&#228;ngige Nachbarstadt Fidenae und die gro&#223;e Etruskermetropole Veji. Die Phalanx-Truppenformation, die man sich von den Griechen abgeschaut hatte, waren f&#252;r K&#228;mpfe in den zerkl&#252;fteten H&#252;geln und T&#228;lern Mittelitaliens allerdings v&#246;llig ungeeignet-es mussten eigene, neue Kampfstrategien entwickelt werden: ein taktisches Vormarschsystem, bei dem unabh&#228;ngig voneinander agierende Legion&#228;re flexible Kampfreihen bildeten. Nun gelang es den R&#246;mern, erfolgreiche Eroberungsfeldz&#252;ge zu f&#252;hren und die Vorherrschaft des R&#246;mischen Reichs in der antiken Welt zu sichern. Nachdem Rom zunehmend an Macht und Einfluss gewonnen hatte, griffen die &#252;brigen unabh&#228;ngigen Stadtstaaten zu den Waffen, der folgende Krieg (340-338 v.Chr.) war jedoch schnell zugunsten Roms entschieden. 264 v.Chr. war bereits das gesamte italienische Gebiet s&#252;dlich der Alpen unter dem Banner Roms "vereint"-entweder waren die V&#246;lker annektiert worden oder sie paktierten mit der Republik. Der unaufhaltsame Aufstieg Roms f&#252;hrte nun zum Konflikt mit Karthago, einer etablierten Wirtschaftsmacht in Nordafrika. Nach insgesamt drei Punischen Kriegen (264-146 v.Chr.) gingen die R&#246;mer am Ende auch hier siegreich hervor und vernichteten die Stadt. Ihr n&#228;chstes ehrgeiziges Ziel war die Vorherrschaft &#252;ber den gesamten Mittelmeerraum. Kurz nacheinander &#252;berrannten die R&#246;mer Syrien, Makedonien, Griechenland und &#196;gypten-allesamt Teile des im Zerfall begriffenen hellenistischen Reichs, das einst von Alexander dem Gro&#223;en begr&#252;ndet worden war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Aber diese Aktivit&#228;ten forderten ihren Tribut: In der Heimat kam es immer h&#228;ufiger zu Unruhen, die letztlich im B&#252;rgerkrieg endeten. Die sp&#228;te Republik erlebte die Auseinandersetzung zwischen Marius und Sulla, den Sklavenaufstand unter der F&#252;hrung des Spartacus und den Aufstieg gro&#223;er Pers&#246;nlichkeiten, wie Pompeius, Cicero und Julius C&#228;sar. Obwohl Letzterer zu Beginn seiner Karriere der Eitelkeit und Unm&#228;nnlichkeit bezichtigt wurde, erwies er sich als brillanter Politiker und Feldherr. C&#228;sar eroberte zwischen 58 und 50 v.Chr. ganz Gallien, bevor er im r&#246;mischen B&#252;rgerkrieg seine Gegner vernichtete und zum unangefochtenen Herrscher Roms aufstieg. Nach C&#228;sars Ermordung im Jahre 44 v.Chr. brach erneut ein B&#252;rgerkrieg aus. 31 v.Chr. siegte C&#228;sars Neffe Octavian in der Schlacht bei Actium und wurde wenig sp&#228;ter der Kaiser Roms (27 v.Chr.-14 n.Chr.). Gleichzeitig nahm er den Ehrennamen "Augustus" an.[PARAGRAPH:2]Von wenigen Ausnahmen wie Caligula (37-41) und Nero (54-68) abgesehen, war das R&#246;mische Reich in den ersten 200 Jahren seiner Existenz mit einer Reihe brillanter Herrscher gesegnet, die das Reich von Britannien bis nach &#196;gypten und von Spanien bis nach Persien ausweiteten. Das R&#246;mische Reich zeichnete sich aber auch durch seine Errungenschaften in der Baukunst und der Politik aus. Besonders erfinderisch waren die R&#246;mer in den Bereichen Gesetzgebung, Verwaltung und Stadtplanung, wobei sie ebenfalls die Erkenntnisse fr&#252;herer V&#246;lker nutzten-vor allem der Griechen, deren Kulturgut so f&#252;r alle Zeit erhalten blieb. Das r&#246;mische Recht wurde im 6. Jh. im Codex Justiniaeus manifestiert, einem komplexen Werk von Pr&#228;zedenzf&#228;llen und Urteilen. Das Stra&#223;ennetzwerk des Reichs war im Altertum unerreicht und f&#246;rderte rasante Fortschritte im Handel, in der Landwirtschaft, im Postwesen und nat&#252;rlich auch im Milit&#228;rwesen. Die r&#246;mischen Stadtplaner setzten mit ihren Rohrleitungs- und Kanalsystemen, D&#228;mmen und Aqu&#228;dukten beispiellose Hygienestandards. Und auch die r&#246;mischen Architektur- und Kunstwerke waren sorgf&#228;ltig geplant und detailgenau ausgef&#252;hrt-wenngleich oftmals der griechische Stil kopiert wurde. Kurz gesagt: Die wissenschaftlichen und kulturellen Errungenschaften des alten Roms waren wegweisend f&#252;r die europ&#228;ische Welt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach dem Tod Mark Aurels im Jahr 180 wurde Rom von einigen schwachen Herrschern zugrunde gerichtet. Selbst die einst so angesehene Pr&#228;torianergarde des Kaisers verkaufte ihre Dienste nun an den Meistbietenden. Nicht zuletzt deshalb verschliss Rom in den folgenden 70 Jahren nicht weniger als 30 Herrscher. Gleichzeitig drohte das Reich angesichts einiger blutiger Aufst&#228;nde und des wachsenden Drucks seiner Nachbarn zusammenzubrechen. Erst Diokletian (284-305) gelang die Wiederherstellung der alten Ordnung. Allerdings gab es unter seiner autorit&#228;ren Herrschaft nur wenig Spielraum f&#252;r pers&#246;nliche Freiheiten. Nach Diokletians R&#252;ckzug ins Privatleben versank Rom erneut im Chaos, bis es Konstantin (306-337) schlie&#223;lich gelang, den blutigen B&#252;rgerkrieg zu beenden. Konstantin war aus zwei Gr&#252;nden bemerkenswert: Zum einen gr&#252;ndete er Konstantinopel als neue Reichshauptstadt. Von hier sollte Byzanz (oder Ostrom) weitere 1000 Jahre regiert werden. Zum anderen legalisierte Konstantin das Christentum und erm&#246;glichte damit die rasche Ausbreitung der Religion in der gesamten r&#246;mischen Welt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach Konstantins Tod zerfiel das Reich in West- und Ostrom. 395 wurde die Teilung schlie&#223;lich besiegelt. Als im 4. und 5. Jahrhundert erneut Barbaren in das R&#246;mische Reich einfielen, brach das geschw&#228;chte Westr&#246;mische Reich endg&#252;ltig zusammen. Der letzte Kaiser des Westr&#246;mischen Reichs, Romulus Augustulus, wurde 476 abgesetzt, nachdem das Reich zu einer Karikatur seiner einstigen Macht verkommen war. Trotz des Niedergangs des R&#246;mischen Reichs als politische Macht hat die r&#246;mische Kultur Europa bis heute nachhaltig gepr&#228;gt.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Roma[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Le origini della fondazione di Roma sulle rive del fertile fiume Tevere si perdono nel mito e nella leggenda, tuttavia sappiamo che parte di ci&#242; che ora chiamiamo Roma fu fondata nel 753 a. C., mentre la nascita della Repubblica risale al 509 a. C., in seguito alla deposizione di Lucio Tarquinio il Superbo, l'ultimo dei sette re di Roma. La citt&#224; fu costruita in una posizione ritenuta molto importante dagli Etruschi, che dominarono la penisola italiana nel VI secolo a. C. Il re etrusco Porsenna sconfisse i Romani ed espulse Tarquinio il Superbo. Tuttavia, prima che Porsenna riuscisse a insediarsi come monarca sugli indisciplinati Romani, fu costretto a ritirarsi. Anzich&#233; riportare al trono il loro inetto sovrano, i cittadini sostituirono la monarchia con due consoli eletti, condottieri il cui principale compito era di comandare gli eserciti di Roma, nonch&#233; un Senato che era un corpo con funzioni consultive. Dove gli Etruschi avevano fallito, i cittadini di Roma riuscirono a unificare le varie popolazioni dell'Italia sotto un unico tetto politico.[PARAGRAPH:2]Verso la fine del V secolo a. C., i Romani, spinti dalle pressione derivante dalla crescita incontrollata della popolazione, iniziarono a espandersi, a spese delle citt&#224;-stato confinanti. Le prime due guerre di Roma furono combattute contro Fidene, una citt&#224; indipendente vicino a Roma, e Veio, un'importante citt&#224; Etrusca. Durante l'espansione, la Repubblica Romana trov&#242; inaffidabile la falange greca per i frammentati combattimenti nelle colline e nelle valli dell'Italia centrale, di conseguenza svilupp&#242; un nuovo sistema tattico, basato su ranghi flessibili e organizzati autonomamente: le legioni. Queste divennero il mezzo principale con cui la Roma Imperiale conquist&#242; e domin&#242; il mondo antico. Mentre Roma diveniva sempre pi&#249; potente, le restanti citt&#224;-stato impugnarono le armi, ma la Guerra Latina (340-338 a. C.) fu decisa rapidamente a favore di Roma. Nel 264 a. C., tutta l'Italia a sud delle Alpi era stata unificata sotto il dominio di Roma, con i suoi membri incorporati nella Repubblica o a essa alleati. La crescente influenza di Roma la port&#242; in conflitto con Cartagine, una solida potenza commerciale del Nord Africa. La sconfitta e la distruzione di Cartagine nelle tre Guerre Puniche (264-146 a. C.) sostenne l'impeto conquistatorio di Roma e la Repubblica pose le mire sul dominio dell'intera area mediterranea. Nel giro di breve tempo, i Romani conquistarono Siria, Macedonia, Grecia ed Egitto: tutte parti del decadente Impero Ellenico creato da Alessandro Magno.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tuttavia, queste conquiste ebbero un prezzo: nella citt&#224; crebbero le tensioni e scoppi&#242; una guerra civile. Il successivo periodo di agitazioni e rivolte contrassegn&#242; la transizione di Roma da repubblica a impero. Le ultime fasi della Repubblica videro la lotta tra Mario e Sulla, le famose rivolte degli schiavi sotto il comando di Spartaco e la nascita di figure illustri come il generale Pompeo, l'oratore Cicerone e il console Giulio Cesare. Sebbene inizialmente congedato con l'accusa di essere un uomo vanitoso ed effeminato, Cesare si dimostr&#242; un abile politico e stratega. Tra il 58 e il 50 a. C., conquist&#242; la Gallia e schiacci&#242; i suoi oppositori in una guerra civile che lo consacr&#242; il padrone indiscusso di Roma. Dopo il suo assassinio, nel 44 a. C., scoppi&#242; una guerra civile e, in seguito alla sua vittoria ad Azio (31 a. C.), Ottaviano venne incoronato primo imperatore Augusto (27 a. C.-14 d. C.).[PARAGRAPH:2]Con alcune pittoresche eccezioni, come Caligola (37-41 d. C.) e Nerone (54-68 d. C.), l'Impero Romano ebbe la fortuna di essere governato da una serie di leader brillanti e capaci durante i suoi primi due secoli di storia, che espansero continuamente le sue frontiere. Al suo apice, l'Impero si estendeva dalla Britannia all'Egitto e dalla Spagna alla Persia. La Roma Imperiale non si distinse solo per il suo esercito (le basi su cui poggi&#242; l'impero), ma anche per i suoi risultati nell'ingegneria e nell'arte della politica. I Romani riuscirono a produrre valide leggi, tenere registrazioni scritte e pianificare lo sviluppo della citt&#224;, pur acquisendo e adottando i contributi dei popoli pi&#249; antichi (in particolare, i Greci, la cui cultura fu in gran parte preservata). La legge Romana era un complesso corpo di precedenti e opinioni, che fu infine codificato nel VI secolo con il nome di Codice Giustiniano. La rete stradale dell'Impero non aveva paragoni nel mondo antico, progettata per rapidi spostamenti del commercio, dell'agricoltura, della consegna della posta e anche dell'esercito. Gli ingegneri Romani raggiunsero standard di igiene all'epoca insuperati con la loro rete di impianti idraulici, raccolta delle acque di scarico, argini e acquedotti. L'arte e l'architettura Romane, malgrado fossero spesso imitazioni degli stili Greci, furono generosamente pianificate e diligentemente applicate. La scienza e la cultura Romane, in breve, divennero le fondamenta del mondo europeo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dopo la morte dell'imperatore Marco Aurelio, nel 180 d. C., l'impero venne gestito da una serie di governatori inadatti. La Guardia Pretoriana, un tempo un rispettato corpo d'elite al servizio dell'imperatore, si ridusse a vendere la propria lealt&#224; al miglior offerente. A met&#224; del III secolo, a Roma si alternarono pi&#249; di 30 imperatori in 70 anni &#232; l'impero fu vicino al crollo per le spinte delle rivolte interne e degli invasori barbarici. L'Impero Diocleziano (284-305 d. C.) riusc&#236; a ripristinare l'ordine, al costo di un governo fortemente autoritario e di una riduzione della libert&#224; personale. Tuttavia, al ritiro di Diocleziano, scoppi&#242; nuovamente il caos, finch&#233; da una nuova serie di guerre civili non emerse vittorioso Costantino (306-337 d. C.). Costantino riusc&#236; a raggiungere due traguardi notevoli: innanzitutto, fond&#242; la citt&#224; di Costantinopoli, per servire come nuova capitale dell'impero nella quale i Bizantini e l'Impero Romano d'Oriente avrebbero resistito per altri mille anni. Inoltre, Costantino legalizz&#242; la religione Cristiana, consentendone una rapida diffusione in tutto il mondo Romano.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dopo la morte di Costantino, l'impero benne diviso nelle parte orientale e in quella occidentale, divisione che divenne permanente nel 395 d. C. Quando l'impero sub&#236; nuovamente le invasioni barbariche del IV e del V secolo, la debole parte occidentale croll&#242;, mentre la parte orientale, nella quale era concentrata gran parte della popolazione e della ricchezza imperiale, riusc&#236; a sopravvivere. L'ultimo imperatore della parte occidentale, Romolo Augusto, venne deposto nel 476 d. C., sebbene l'Impero d'Occidente fosse rimasto una finzione solo di nome gi&#224; da diversi decenni. Sebbene distrutta come entit&#224; politica, la cultura latina dell'Impero Romano &#232; in gran parte sopravvissuta e ancora oggi pu&#242; essere osservata in tutto il Mediterraneo.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Roma[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Los comienzos de Roma en el f&#233;rtil r&#237;o T&#237;ber se confunden entre el mito y la leyenda, pero sabemos que partes de lo que hoy llamamos Roma fueron pobladas por primera vez en el 753 a. C., aunque la Rep&#250;blica de Roma no se fundar&#237;a hasta el 509 a. C., tras ser derrocado Lucio Tarquino el Soberbio, &#250;ltimo de los siete reyes de Roma. La ciudad fue construida en un lugar muy apreciado por los etruscos, dominadores de la pen&#237;nsula it&#225;lica en el siglo VI a. C. El rey etrusco Porsenna derrot&#243; a los romanos y expuls&#243; a Tarquino el Soberbio. Pero antes de que Porsenna pudiera establecerse como monarca de los rebeldes romanos, se vio obligado a retirarse. En lugar de sustituir a su inepto rey, los ciudadanos reemplazaron la monarqu&#237;a con dos c&#243;nsules electos, generales cuya principal labor era dirigir a los ej&#233;rcitos de Roma, y un Senado que ejerc&#237;a de cuerpo consultivo. Los habitantes de Roma tuvieron &#233;xito all&#237; donde hab&#237;an fracasado los etruscos: en la labor de unificar a los diversos pueblos italianos bajo una sola entidad pol&#237;tica.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hacia finales del siglo V a. C., los romanos, impulsados por la presi&#243;n de un crecimiento desenfrenado de su poblaci&#243;n, empezaron a expandirse a costa de las ciudades-estado vecinas. Las primeras dos guerras libradas por Roma fueron contra Fidenas, una cercana ciudad independiente, y contra Veii, una importante ciudad etrusca. En el proceso, la rep&#250;blica romana en expansi&#243;n aprendi&#243; que la falange de origen griego era una t&#225;ctica poco flexible para el combate poco sistem&#225;tico que caracterizaba a las colinas y valles de la Italia central; por consiguiente, los romanos desarrollaron un sistema nuevo, basado en las flexibles cohortes, organizadas a su vez en legiones autosuficientes, que ser&#237;a el medio empleado por la Roma imperial para conquistar el mundo antiguo. En respuesta al imparable crecimiento de la fortaleza de Roma, las dem&#225;s ciudades-estado se alzaron en armas; la guerra contra la Liga Latina (340-338 a. C.) que tuvo lugar a continuaci&#243;n se decidi&#243; r&#225;pidamente a su favor. En el 264 a. C., toda Italia al sur de los Alpes hab&#237;a sido unificada bajo su liderazgo, y sus ciudades hab&#237;an sido absorbidas o eran aliadas suyas. La creciente influencia de Roma hizo que entrara en conflicto con Cartago, importante potencia mercantil del norte de &#193;frica. La derrota y destrucci&#243;n de Cartago en las tres Guerras P&#250;nicas (264-146 a. C.) prolong&#243; el &#237;mpetu codicioso de Roma, y la rep&#250;blica puso sus miras en la dominaci&#243;n de todo el Mediterr&#225;neo. En poco tiempo, los romanos invadieron Siria, Macedonia, Grecia y Egipto, pa&#237;ses todos que hab&#237;an formado parte del imperio helen&#237;stico creado por Alejandro y que ahora se descompon&#237;an.[PARAGRAPH:2]Pero toda aquella expansi&#243;n no sali&#243; barata; surgieron tensiones y hubo una guerra civil. El periodo que sigui&#243; de desorden y revoluci&#243;n marc&#243; la transici&#243;n de Roma de rep&#250;blica a imperio. La rep&#250;blica tard&#237;a presenci&#243; el enfrentamiento entre Mario y Sila, el famoso levantamiento de los esclavos de Espartaco y el ascenso de figuras como el general Pompeyo, el orador Cicer&#243;n y el c&#243;nsul Julio C&#233;sar. Aunque al comienzo de su carrera fue objeto de desprecio por venal y afeminado, C&#233;sar acabar&#237;a por demostrar que era un extraordinario pol&#237;tico y militar. Entre los a&#241;os 58 y 50 a. C., conquist&#243; la Galia, y a continuaci&#243;n procedi&#243; a aplastar a sus adversarios en una guerra civil de la que emergi&#243; como se&#241;or indiscutible de Roma. Tras su asesinato en el 44 a. C., no tard&#243; mucho en volver a estallar la guerra civil: pero con su victoria en Actium, Octavio, sobrino de Julio, fue coronado primer emperador de Roma, tomando el nombre de Augusto, 24 a. C.-14 d. C.).[PARAGRAPH:2]Aunque hubo algunas excepciones notables como Cal&#237;gula (37-41) y Ner&#243;n (54-68), el Imperio Romano disfrut&#243; durante sus dos primeros siglos de vida de una serie de l&#237;deres capaces y brillantes que expandieron las fronteras hasta que el imperio abarc&#243; desde Britania hasta Egipto y desde Hispania hasta Persia. La Roma imperial no solo destac&#243; por su ej&#233;rcito (la base sobre la que descansaba su poder), sino por sus grandes logros en los campos de la ingenier&#237;a y la pol&#237;tica. Los romanos ten&#237;an talento para las artes aplicadas de la ley, la conservaci&#243;n de documentos y la planificaci&#243;n urbana, pero tambi&#233;n reconoc&#237;an y adoptaban las contribuciones de los pueblos anteriores a ellos; principalmente las de los griegos, cuya cultura conservaron en gran parte. El derecho romano estaba formado por un complejo cuerpo de precedentes y opiniones, que finalmente fueron codificados en el siglo VI como el C&#243;digo de Justiniano. La red de v&#237;as del imperio no ten&#237;a rival en el mundo antiguo, y fue dise&#241;ada para el r&#225;pido desplazamiento del comercio, la agricultura y el correo, as&#237; como para cubrir las necesidades del ej&#233;rcito. La planificaci&#243;n urban&#237;stica romana alcanz&#243; niveles sin precedentes de higiene gracias a sus ca&#241;er&#237;as, red de cloacas, presas y acueductos. Aunque a veces imitaban los estilos griegos, el arte y la arquitectura romanos eran ejemplos de audacia en la planificaci&#243;n y excelencia en la ejecuci&#243;n. En resumen, la ciencia y la cultura romanas se convirtieron en los cimientos del mundo europeo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tras la muerte del emperador Marco Aurelio (180 d. C.), el imperio aguant&#243; a una serie de p&#233;simos gobernantes. La guardia pretoriana, originalmente una respetada unidad de elite consagrada a la protecci&#243;n del emperador, se convirti&#243; en un cuerpo mercenario que se vend&#237;a al mejor postor. En los a&#241;os centrales del siglo III, Roma soport&#243; m&#225;s de treinta emperadores en un lapso de setenta a&#241;os, y el imperio estuvo a punto de desplomarse bajo la presi&#243;n de las revueltas internas y los invasores b&#225;rbaros. El emperador Diocleciano (284-305) logr&#243; restaurar el orden, al precio de imponer un autoritarismo estricto que apenas dejaba espacio a la libertad individual. Tras el retiro de Diocleciano surgieron nuevos disturbios, hasta que Constantino (306-337) logr&#243; emerger victorioso de una nueva serie de guerras civiles. Constantino tuvo dos logros especialmente importantes; primero, fund&#243; la ciudad de Constantinopla como nueva capital del imperio, con la que el Imperio Bizantino, o Imperio Romano de Oriente, perdurar&#237;a otros mil a&#241;os. Segundo, legaliz&#243; la religi&#243;n cristiana, lo que permiti&#243; que se difundiera con mucha mayor rapidez por el mundo romano.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tras la muerte de Constantino, el imperio se dividi&#243; en sus mitades occidentales y orientales, divisi&#243;n que se convirti&#243; en permanente en el a&#241;o 395. Cuando los b&#225;rbaros volvieron a asaltar las fronteras del imperio en los siglos IV y V, el debilitado oeste se derrumb&#243;, pero el este, donde se concentraban la mayor parte de la poblaci&#243;n y la riqueza del imperio, logr&#243; sobrevivir. El &#250;ltimo emperador del oeste, R&#243;mulo Aug&#250;stulo, fue depuesto en el a&#241;o 476, aunque es cierto que este imperio se hab&#237;a convertido en una mera ficci&#243;n d&#233;cadas antes. Aunque el Imperio Romano fue destruido como entidad pol&#237;tica, la cultura latina sobrevivi&#243;, y su influencia todav&#237;a se percibe en el mundo mediterr&#225;neo de nuestros d&#237;as.</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]The Egyptians[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Few civilizations have left such an indelible mark on history as that of ancient Egypt. Though the first settlers of the Nile valley are thought to have arrived as early as 7000 BC, it wasn't until the legendary king Menes unified Upper and Lower Egypt that the region began to develop a cohesive sense of culture and identity. This First Dynasty (2925-2775 BC), with its capital at Memphis, was followed by 26 more over the next 2700 years. Writing was the major instrument in the centralization and self-preservation of Egypt. The two basic forms of writing, hieroglyphs and the cursive form known as hieratic (used on papyrus), were invented at much the same time in late pre-dynastic Egypt (about 3000 BC). Writing was used chiefly for administration and until about 2650 BC no continuous texts were recorded; the only literary texts written down before the early Middle Kingdom (1950 BC) seem to have been lists of religious practices and medical treatises. Another strength was the Egyptian religion, which was one of the most enduring of the ancient world, through which Egypt became a highly stratified, highly efficient society. Egypt's economic strength allowed for the support of a priestly class, who were tasked with the spiritual well being of the people yet able to devote their time to the study of religion, astronomy, philosophy, and mathematics. The priesthood also served the functions of a state bureaucracy, carrying out the edicts of the Pharaoh and managing his financial and diplomatic affairs. The great organizational and economic power of Egypt allowed the rulers to accomplish unmatched works of construction. The Great Pyramids of Giza, completed in the Fourth Dynasty (2575-2465 BC), still stand as one of mankind's most impressive feats of engineering and logistics.[PARAGRAPH:2]Prior to 1700 BC, no outsiders had ever held dominion over Egypt. That changed when the Hyksos, a Semitic people, overran Lower Egypt. Thereafter, Egypt's borders were defended by capable Libyan warriors and the elite often rode into battle in War Chariots, which were able to use speed to outflank opponents and break up organized formations of troops. It was under the rule of Hatshepsut, a woman who managed to exercise power despite the prohibition that the pharaoh must be male, that the Hyksos were driven out of the country through the use of such chariots. Egypt's greatest military strength, however, lay in the employment of mercenaries from Macedonia, Greece, Nubia and many other neighboring peoples-Egyptian gold was always their most valuable military asset. However, this was not enough to guarantee the isolation of the richest land in the Mediterranean world. Egypt fell to the Assyrians, and then to the Persians yet even during the plunder of Xerxes' governors, Egyptian culture and religion survived. Alexander the Great liberated the Egyptians from Persian rule in 332 BC and established the city of Alexandria, which was to become the new capital of Hellenic Egypt under the rule of the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty (332-30 BC), the last Egyptian kingdom. The kingdom was one of several that emerged in the aftermath of Alexander's death and the struggles of his successors. It was the wealthiest, however, and for much of the next 300 years, the most powerful politically and militarily.[PARAGRAPH:2]The able Ptolemies ruled in an unbroken line until the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC. Her suicide marked the end of Pharaonic rule and the beginning of Egypt's centuries as a Roman and Byzantine province. Although swept by the Islamic tide in 642 AD, Egypt was to remain under foreign occupation-Arabic, Ottoman, French, and British-until after World War I, when she finally gained her independence from a British administration weary of overseas conflict. From 1922 through 1952, Egypt appeared to be one of the world's most successful constitutional monarchies. But it was ripe for revolution; the military coup of July 1952 led by Gamal Nasser, ironically, finally made Egypt an island of stability in a turbulent Middle East.</English>
		<French>[H1]Les Egyptiens[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Peu de civilisations ont marqu&#233; l'histoire aussi durablement que l'Egypte ancienne. Si on estime que les premiers colons de la vall&#233;e du Nil sont arriv&#233;s vers l'an 7000 av. J.-C., il faut attendre l'unification de la Basse-Egypte et de la Haute-Egypte par le l&#233;gendaire roi M&#233;n&#232;s pour que la r&#233;gion commence &#224; d&#233;velopper un sentiment de communaut&#233; de culture et d'identit&#233;. La premi&#232;re dynastie (2925-2775 av. J.-C.), dont la capitale est Memphis, est suivie par 26 autres au cours des 2 700 ann&#233;es suivantes. L'&#233;criture constitue le principal instrument de la centralisation et de l'autoconservation de l'Egypte. Les deux formes de base de l'&#233;criture, les hi&#233;roglyphes et la cursive, &#233;galement appel&#233;e hi&#233;ratique (et utilis&#233;e sur du papyrus), sont invent&#233;es &#224; peu pr&#232;s &#224; la m&#234;me &#233;poque, &#224; la fin de l'Egypte pr&#233;dynastique (vers 3000 av. J.-C.). L'&#233;criture est essentiellement utilis&#233;e dans l'administration et jusqu'en 2650 av. J.-C. environ, on ne conna&#238;t aucun long texte. Les seuls textes litt&#233;raires &#233;crits avant le d&#233;but du Moyen Empire (1950 av. J.-C.) semblent avoir &#233;t&#233; des listes de pratiques religieuses et de traitements m&#233;dicaux. Une autre force r&#233;side dans la religion &#233;gyptienne, qui constitue l'une des plus r&#233;sistantes du monde antique, et qui permet &#224; l'Egypte de devenir une soci&#233;t&#233; tr&#232;s stratifi&#233;e et tr&#232;s efficace. La puissance &#233;conomique de l'Egypte lui vaut le soutien de la classe sacerdotale, charg&#233;e du bien-&#234;tre spirituel de la population mais n&#233;anmoins capable de consacrer du temps &#224; l'&#233;tude de la religion, de l'astronomie, de la philosophie et des math&#233;matiques. Le clerg&#233; assure &#233;galement les fonctions bureaucratiques de l'Etat, fait ex&#233;cuter les &#233;dits du Pharaon et g&#232;re ses affaires financi&#232;res et diplomatiques. L'immense puissance organisationnelle et &#233;conomique de l'Egypte permet &#224; ses dirigeants de r&#233;aliser des travaux de construction in&#233;gal&#233;s. Les grandes pyramides de Gizeh, achev&#233;es sous la quatri&#232;me dynastie (2575-2465 av. J.-C.), constituent encore aujourd'hui l'une des prouesses d'ing&#233;nierie et de logistique les plus impressionnantes au monde.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jusqu'en 1700 av. J.-C., date &#224; laquelle les Hyksos, un peuple s&#233;mite, envahissent la Basse-Egypte, aucun &#233;tranger n'a jamais assis sa domination sur l'Egypte. Par la suite, les fronti&#232;res de l'Egypte sont d&#233;fendues gr&#226;ce aux comp&#233;tences des guerriers libyens, tandis que les &#233;lites s'engagent souvent &#224; cheval dans la bataille, dans des chars de guerre capables d'utiliser leur vitesse pour d&#233;border les opposants et disperser les formations de troupes organis&#233;es. Sous le r&#232;gne de la reine Hatshepsout, qui r&#233;ussit &#224; exercer le pouvoir alors que la fonction de pharaon est normalement r&#233;serv&#233;e &#224; un homme, ces chars contribuent &#224; chasser les Hyksos du pays. La principale force militaire de l'Egypte repose toutefois sur le recours &#224; des mercenaires de Mac&#233;doine, de Gr&#232;ce, de Nubie et de nombreuses autres contr&#233;es voisines. L'or &#233;gyptien constitue toujours son atout militaire le plus pr&#233;cieux mais il n'est pas suffisant pour garantir l'isolement de ce pays le plus riche du monde m&#233;diterran&#233;en. L'Egypte tombe aux mains des Assyriens, puis des Perses. Toutefois, m&#234;me durant le pillage des gouverneurs de Xerx&#232;s, la culture et la religion &#233;gyptiennes survivent. En 332 av. J.-C., Alexandre le Grand lib&#232;re l'Egypte de la domination perse et fonde la ville d'Alexandrie, qui deviendra la nouvelle capitale de l'Egypte hell&#233;nistique sous le r&#232;gne de la dynastie mac&#233;donienne des Ptol&#233;m&#233;es (332-30 av. J.-C.). Ce dernier royaume d'Egypte constitue l'un de ceux apparus &#224; la mort d'Alexandre le Grand, au gr&#233; des conflits de ses successeurs. Il est toutefois le plus riche et pendant la majorit&#233; des 300 ann&#233;es suivantes, le plus puissant sur le plan politique et militaire.[PARAGRAPH:2]La comp&#233;tence de la dynastie ptol&#233;m&#233;enne lui permet de r&#233;gner de mani&#232;re ininterrompue jusqu'&#224; la mort de Cl&#233;op&#226;tre VII en 30 av. J.-C. Son suicide symbolise la fin du r&#232;gne des pharaons et le d&#233;but d'une p&#233;riode de plusieurs si&#232;cles pendant lesquels l'Egypte devient une province romaine puis byzantine. Balay&#233;e par la vague islamique en 642 ap. J.-C., l'Egypte reste toutefois sous occupation &#233;trang&#232;re, arabe, ottomane, fran&#231;aise et britannique jusqu'&#224; la fin de la Premi&#232;re Guerre mondiale, o&#249; elle acquiert finalement son ind&#233;pendance aupr&#232;s de l'administration britannique, lasse des conflits outre-mer. De 1922 &#224; 1952, l'Egypte appara&#238;t comme l'une des monarchies constitutionnelles les plus brillantes du monde. La r&#233;volution couve cependant et le coup d'Etat militaire de juillet 1952 men&#233; par Gamal Nasser fait alors de l'Egypte, contre toute attente, un &#238;lot de stabilit&#233; dans un Moyen-Orient fort tumultueux.</French>
		<German>[H1]Die &#196;gypter[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Nur wenige Kulturen haben die Geschichte so nachhaltig beeinflusst wie die alten &#196;gypter. Erste Siedler hatten sich bereits um 7000 v.Chr. im Niltal niedergelassen, vereint wurden das untere und das obere &#196;gypten jedoch erst unter der Herrschaft des legend&#228;ren K&#246;nigs Menes, was auch die Entwicklung einer einheitlichen Kultur sowie eigener Traditionen und Gebr&#228;uche erm&#246;glichte. Dieser ersten Herrscherdynastie (2925-2775 v.Chr.) mit Sitz in Memphis sollten im Laufe der folgenden 2700 Jahre noch 26 weitere folgen. Die Schrift war dabei ein wichtiges Instrument f&#252;r die Zentralisierung und Selbsterhaltung &#196;gyptens. Sie diente in erster Linie f&#252;r administrative Zwecke. Ihre beiden Grundformen, die Hieroglyphen und die hieratische Schrift (eine Schreibschrift, die auf Papyrus &#252;bertragen wurde), wurden in etwa zeitgleich im sp&#228;ten pr&#228;dynastischen &#196;gypten (etwa 3000 v.Chr.) entwickelt. Bis ca. 2650 v.Chr. gibt es keine Aufzeichnungen zusammenh&#228;ngender Texte-vor dem fr&#252;hen mittleren K&#246;nigreich (1950 v.Chr.) scheinen ausschlie&#223;lich religi&#246;se Praktiken und medizinische Abhandlungen dokumentiert worden zu sein. Eine weitere St&#228;rke der &#196;gypter war ihre Religion, die zu den solidesten und langlebigsten des Altertums z&#228;hlte und der es zuzuschreiben ist, dass sich das &#228;gyptische Volk zu einer vielschichtigen, leistungsf&#228;higen Gesellschaft entwickelte. Dank der wirtschaftlichen St&#228;rke des Landes konnte man sich eine eigene Priesterklasse leisten, die sich um das seelische Wohlergehen der B&#252;rger k&#252;mmerte und zugleich Studien in den Bereichen Religion, Astronomie, Philosophie und Mathematik durchf&#252;hrte. Dar&#252;ber hinaus diente die Priesterschaft auch als b&#252;rokratisches Organ, das f&#252;r die Umsetzung der Erlasse des Pharaos zust&#228;ndig war und seine finanziellen und diplomatischen Angelegenheiten regelte. Nicht zuletzt wegen des enormen organisatorischen und wirtschaftlichen Leistungsverm&#246;gens der &#196;gypter waren ihre Herrscher in der Lage, den Bau einzigartiger Monumente zu realisieren. Bis heute z&#228;hlen die gro&#223;en Pyramiden von Gizeh, die aus der 4. Dynastie (2575-2465 v.Chr.) datieren, in architektonischer und logistischer Hinsicht zu den beeindruckendsten Bauwerken der Weltgeschichte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vor 1700 v.Chr. hatten Au&#223;enstehende keinen nennenswerten Einfluss in &#196;gypten gehabt. Das &#228;nderte sich jedoch, als das Semitenvolk der Hyskos im unteren &#196;gypten einmarschierte, woraufhin libysche Krieger und Elitek&#228;mpfer zur Sicherung der Landesgrenzen eingesetzt wurden. Die ihnen oftmals zur Verf&#252;gung stehenden Kriegsstreitwagen verschafften ihnen einen gro&#223;en Mobilit&#228;tsvorteil, durch den sie feindliche Truppenformationen geschickt ausman&#246;vrieren und aufbrechen konnten. Unter der Herrschaft Hatschepsuts, einer der wenigen Frauen auf dem Thron des Pharaos, wurden die Hyksos mithilfe von Streitwagen aus dem Land vertrieben. Die st&#228;rkste milit&#228;rische Kraft &#196;gyptens waren jedoch die aus Makedonien, Griechenland, Nubien und anderen Nachbarl&#228;ndern angeheuerten S&#246;ldner-wobei das &#228;gyptische Gold sehr hilfreich war. Aber auch diese Streitkr&#228;fte waren keine Garanten f&#252;r die absolute Sicherheit des reichsten Landes im mediterranen Raum: &#196;gypten fiel an die Assyrer und dann an die Perser-dennoch &#252;berdauerten die &#228;gyptische Kultur und Religion selbst die Pl&#252;nderungen von Xerxes' Statthaltern. 332 v.Chr. befreite Alexander der Gro&#223;e das Land aus den F&#228;ngen der Perser, errichtete die Stadt Alexandria und machte sie zur neuen Hauptstadt der makedonischen Herrscherdynastie der Ptolem&#228;er (332-30 v.Chr.) im hellenistischen &#196;gypten. Dieses letzte &#228;gyptische K&#246;nigreich geh&#246;rte zu den wenigen, die die Zeit nach Alexanders Tod und den Kampf um seine Nachfolge &#252;berstanden und blieb in den n&#228;chsten 300 Jahren auch das reichste und politisch sowie milit&#228;risch m&#228;chtigste Reich.[PARAGRAPH:2]Bis zum Tod Kleopatras VII. im Jahre 30 v.Chr. hatten die Ptolem&#228;er ununterbrochen den Thron innegehabt. Ihr Selbstmord war gleichbedeutend mit dem Zeitalter der Pharaonen. &#196;gypten verkam zu einer r&#246;mischen und sp&#228;ter byzantinischen Provinz. Nachdem 642 der Islam Einzug in &#196;gypten gehalten hatte, blieb es bis nach dem 1. Weltkrieg besetzt-von den Arabern, T&#252;rken, Franzosen und Briten. Erst 1922 erhielt es einen Teil seiner Unabh&#228;ngigkeit von der britischen Regierung zur&#252;ck, die angesichts des langen &#220;berseekonflikts kampfm&#252;de geworden war. Von 1922 bis 1952 behauptete sich &#196;gypten als eine der erfolgreichsten konstitutionellen Monarchien der Welt, dann aber kam der Umbruch: Ironischerweise sorgte ausgerechnet der im Juli 1952 von Gamal Nasser gef&#252;hrte Milit&#228;rputsch daf&#252;r, dass sich &#196;gypten nach all den turbulenten Jahren zu einer Oase der Stabilit&#228;t und Best&#228;ndigkeit im Mittleren Osten entwickelte.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]Gli Egizi[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Poche civilt&#224; hanno lasciato un segno cos&#236; indelebile nella storia come gli antichi Egizi. Malgrado si pensi che i primi coloni della valle del Nilo siano arrivati attorno al 7000 a. C., solo con il leggendario re Menes vennero unificati il Basso e l'Alto Egitto, dopodich&#233; la regione inizi&#242; a sviluppare un senso comune di cultura e civilt&#224;. La Prima Dinastia (2925-2775 a. C.), con capitale a Menfi, fu seguita da altre 26 nei successivi 2.700 anni. La scrittura fu lo strumento principale della centralizzazione e della conservazione dell'Egitto. Le due forme base di scrittura, i geroglifici e la forma corsiva conosciuta come ieratica (usata sul papiro), vennero inventate in corrispondenza del tardo Egitto pre-dinastico (attorno al 3000 a. C.). La scrittura era usata principalmente per l'amministrazione e fino a circa il 2650 a. C. non vennero registrati dei testi continui. Gli unici testi letterari scritti prima del periodo iniziale del Regno di Mezzo (1950 a. C.) sembrano gli elenchi delle pratiche religiose e delle cure mediche. Un altro punto di forza era la religione egizia, una delle pi&#249; solide del mondo antico, attraverso cui l'Egitto divenne una societ&#224; altamente stratificata ed efficiente. La crescita economica dell'Egitto consent&#236; il mantenimento di un corpo di sacerdoti, che provvedevano al benessere spirituale della gente, ma trovavano il tempo di dedicarsi allo studio della religione, dell'astronomia, della filosofia e della matematica. La classe sacerdotale gestiva anche la burocrazia dello stato, applicando gli editti del Faraone e gestendo i suoi affari finanziari e diplomatici. La grande potenza organizzativa ed economica dell'Egitto consent&#236; ai governatori di realizzare lavori di costruzione senza confronti. Le Grandi Piramidi di Giza, completate nella Quarta Dinastia (2575-2465 a. C.), sono a tutt'oggi considerate come una delle pi&#249; impressionanti opere di ingegneria e di logistica dell'umanit&#224;.[PARAGRAPH:2]Prima del 1700 a. C., nessun esterno aveva dominato l'Egitto, ma la situazione cambi&#242; quando gli Hyksos, una popolazione semitica, conquistarono il Basso Egitto. In seguito, i confini dell'Egitto furono difesi da guerrieri Libici e l'&#233;lite spesso entr&#242; in battaglia con i carri da guerra, che aggiravano gli avversari e rompevano le formazioni delle truppe. Fu sotto il dominio di Hatshepsut, una donna che riusc&#236; a ottenere il potere nonostante i faraoni dovessero essere soltanto uomini, che gli Hyksos furono cacciati dal paese grazie all'uso dei carri. In ogni caso, la pi&#249; grande forza militare dell'Egitto, erano i mercenari provenienti dalla Macedonia, dalla Grecia, dalla Nubia e da molte altre popolazioni circostanti; l'oro dell'Egitto era sempre il punto di forza del loro esercito. Questo non era comunque sufficiente a garantire l'isolamento delle terre pi&#249; ricche nel mondo che si affacciava al Mediterraneo. L'Egitto cadde sotto gli attacchi degli Assiri e, in seguito, dei Persiani, ma, malgrado i saccheggi del governo di Xerxes, la sua cultura e la sua religione sopravvissero. Alessandro Magno liber&#242; gli Egizi dal giogo Persiano nel 332 a. C. e fond&#242; la citt&#224; di Alessandria, che sarebbe diventata la nuova capitale dell'Egitto Ellenico sotto il dominio della dinastia Tolemaica Macedone (332-30 a. C.), l'ultimo periodo di sovranit&#224; dell'Egitto. Il regno fu uno dei tanti sorti dopo la morte di Alessandro e le lotte dei suoi successori. Fra tutti, fu il pi&#249; prospero e, per gran parte dei successivi 300 anni, il pi&#249; potente dal punto di vista politico e militare.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gli abili Tolomei governarono per successione dinastica fino alla morte di Cleopatra VII nel 30 a. C. Il suo suicidio segn&#242; la fine dei Faraoni d'Egitto e l'inizio dei numerosi anni di vita come provincia Romana e Bizantina. Travolto dall'ondata Islamica nel 642 d. C., l'Egitto sarebbe rimasto occupato dagli stranieri (Arabi, Ottomani, Francesi e Inglesi) fino al termine della Prima Guerra Mondiale, quando ottenne finalmente l'indipendenza da un'amministrazione inglese stanca dei conflitti all'estero. Dal 1922 al 1952, l'Egitto parve una delle monarchie costituzionali di maggior successo, ma era sull'orlo di una rivoluzione: ironia della sorte, il colpo di stato militare del luglio 1952, a opera di Gamal Nasser, rese finalmente l'Egitto un'isola di stabilit&#224; nel turbolento Medio Oriente.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]Los egipcios[\H1][NEWLINE][TAB]Pocas civilizaciones han dejado una marca tan indeleble en la historia como la del antiguo Egipto. Aunque se cree que los primeros pobladores del valle del Nilo llegaron en el 7000 a. C., no fue hasta la unificaci&#243;n del Alto y el Bajo Egipto, llevada a cabo por el legendario rey Menes, cuando la regi&#243;n empez&#243; a desarrollar un sentido cohesionado de cultura e identidad. La I dinast&#237;a (2925-2775 a. C.), con su capital en Menfis, fue seguida por otras 26 durante los siguientes 2700 a&#241;os. La escritura fue el principal instrumento de centralizaci&#243;n y auto-preservaci&#243;n de Egipto. Las dos formas b&#225;sicas de escritura, los jerogl&#237;ficos y la forma cursiva conocida como hier&#225;tica (usada sobre papiro) se inventaron de forma m&#225;s o menos simult&#225;nea en el Egipto predin&#225;stico tard&#237;o (alrededor del 3000 d. C.). Se usaba sobre todo para cuestiones administrativas, y hasta el 2650 a. C. no se registraron textos continuos; los &#250;nicos textos literarios escritos antes del primer periodo intermedio (1950 a. C.) parece que eran listas de pr&#225;cticas religiosas y tratamientos m&#233;dicos. Otro punto fuerte fue la religi&#243;n egipcia, una de las m&#225;s duraderas del mundo antiguo, que transform&#243; Egipto en una sociedad tan estratificada como eficaz. La fortaleza econ&#243;mica del pa&#237;s permit&#237;a el sustento de una clase sacerdotal, que estaba a cargo del bienestar espiritual del pueblo, y al mismo tiempo pod&#237;a dedicar tiempo al estudio de la religi&#243;n, la astronom&#237;a, la filosof&#237;a y las matem&#225;ticas. El clero tambi&#233;n cumpl&#237;a las funciones de una burocracia estatal, llevando a cabo los edictos del fara&#243;n y dirigiendo sus asuntos financieros y diplom&#225;ticos. El gran potencial organizativo y econ&#243;mico de Egipto permiti&#243; a los gobernantes realizar obras p&#250;blicas sin parang&#243;n. Las grandes pir&#225;mides de Gizeh, acabadas en la IV dinast&#237;a (2575-2465 a. C.), siguen siendo una de las obras de ingenier&#237;a y log&#237;stica m&#225;s impresionantes del mundo.[PARAGRAPH:2]Antes del 1700 a. C., ning&#250;n pueblo extranjero hab&#237;a logrado conquistar Egipto. Eso cambi&#243; cuando los hicsos, un pueblo semita, se apoder&#243; del Bajo Egipto. A partir de aquel momento, la defensa de las fronteras qued&#243; en manos de diestros guerreros libios, mientras que la elite a menudo acud&#237;a a la batalla en carros de guerra, cuya velocidad pod&#237;a aprovecharse para superar a sus rivales y romper sus formaciones. Fue durante el gobierno de Hatshepsut, una mujer que logr&#243; ejercer el poder a pesar de que la ley establec&#237;a que el fara&#243;n deb&#237;a ser var&#243;n, cuando se consigui&#243; expulsar a los hicsos empleando estos carros. La principal ventaja militar de Egipto, sin embargo, resid&#237;a en el uso de mercenarios de Macedonia, Grecia, Nubia y muchas otras regiones vecinas: el oro egipcio siempre fue su activo militar m&#225;s importante. No obstante, esto no bast&#243; para garantizar al aislamiento del pa&#237;s m&#225;s rico del mundo mediterr&#225;neo. Egipto cay&#243; en manos de los asirios y luego de los persas, pero incluso bajo el voraz dominio de los gobernadores de Jerjes, la cultura y la religi&#243;n egipcias sobrevivieron. Alejandro Magno liber&#243; a los egipcios del yugo persa en el 332 a. C. y fund&#243; la ciudad de Alejandr&#237;a, que se convertir&#237;a en la nueva capital del Egipto hel&#233;nico bajo el gobierno de la dinast&#237;a tolemaica macedonia (332-30 a. C.), el &#250;ltimo reino egipcio, y uno de los muchos que surgieron a la muerte de Alejandro por las luchas entre sus sucesores. Sin embargo, fue el m&#225;s pr&#243;spero y, durante la mayor parte de los siguientes trescientos a&#241;os, el m&#225;s poderoso desde el punto de vista pol&#237;tico y militar.[PARAGRAPH:2]Los competentes Tolomeos gobernaron ininterrumpidamente hasta la muerte de Cleopatra VII en el a&#241;o 30 a. C. Su suicidio se&#241;al&#243; el final del gobierno fara&#243;nico y el comienzo de los siglos en que Egipto ser&#237;a una provincia romana y bizantina. Aunque engullida por la marea isl&#225;mica en el a&#241;o 642 d. C., Egipto permanecer&#237;a bajo ocupaci&#243;n extranjera (&#225;rabe, otomana, francesa y brit&#225;nica) hasta despu&#233;s de la Primera Guerra Mundial, cuando finalmente obtuvo su independencia de una administraci&#243;n brit&#225;nica harta de conflictos coloniales. Desde 1922 hasta 1952, pareci&#243; ser una de las monarqu&#237;as constitucionales m&#225;s pr&#243;speras del mundo. Pero la revoluci&#243;n era inminente; ir&#243;nicamente, el golpe militar de julio de 1952 encabezado por Gamal Nasser convirti&#243; finalmente a Egipto en una isla de estabilidad en medio de la turbulencia de Oriente Medio.</Spanish>

		<German>Haupts&#228;chlich findet man Elfenbein in den Sto&#223;z&#228;hnen von Elefanten, aber auch bei Nilpferden, Wildschweinen, Walrossen und verschiedenen Walarten. Deshalb wurden und werden diese Tiere, besonders die Elefanten wegen ihrer Sto&#223;z&#228;hne gewildert. [NEWLINE]Die Bezeichnung Elfenbein ist zusammengesetzt aus den W&#246;rtern "elephas" (griech.) f&#252;r Elefant. Aus dem mittelhochdeutschen "helfant" und "bein", einer alten Bezeichnung f&#252;r Knochen entsteht "Elfenbein", was aber mit Elfen nichts zu tun hat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Zur begehrten Handelsware wurde afrikanisches Elfenbein sp&#228;testens im 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr., und zwar durch die Ph&#246;nizier, deren Kerngebiet im heutigen Libanon und Syrien lag. Die Ph&#246;nizier waren das bekannteste und erfolgreichste Handelsvolk der Antike. Dar&#252;ber hinaus waren sie auch als ausgezeichnete Elfenbeinschnitzer bekannt und belieferten mit ihren Produkten bereits im 16. Jahrhundert v. Chr. den &#228;gyptischen und sp&#228;ter auch den israelitischen Hof.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Das Rohmaterial f&#252;r die ph&#246;nizischen Elfenbeinschnitzereien stammte zum einen aus Syrien, zum anderen aber auch aus dem legend&#228;ren Land Punt, das am Roten Meer vermutet wird. Au&#223;erdem hatten die Ph&#246;nizier von Karthago aus (Gr&#252;ndung: Ende des 9. Jahrhundert v. Chr.) Zugriff auf den Atlaselefanten. Es handelte sich dabei um eine kleinw&#252;chsige Elefantenart, die zum einen zu Kriegszwecken abgerichtet wurde und die zum anderen auch wegen der Sto&#223;z&#228;hne gejagt wurde. Die permanente Verfolgung dieser Elefantenart f&#252;hrte dazu, dass sie Ende des 4. Jahrhundert n.

		<Spanish>La definici&#243;n del marfil [Marfil : &#225;rabe mar-al-fil, hueso del elefante], seg&#250;n la Real Academia Espa&#241;ola es:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]  Materia dura, compacta y blanca de que principalmente est&#225;n formados los dientes de los vertebrados, que en la corona est&#225; cubierta por el esmalte y en la ra&#237;z por el cemento. En la industria se utilizaba, para la fabricaci&#243;n de numerosos objetos, el de los colmillos de los elefantes. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la pr&#225;ctica, la palabra marfil se aplica tambi&#233;n a los dientes de otros animales como el mamut o la morsa, de caracteres f&#237;sicos similares a los de los incisivos de los elefantes. Pero debe quedar claro que est&#225; bien aplicar la palabra marfil a los dientes de cualquier vertebrado, inclusive el hombre. Adem&#225;s, al hablarse de talla del marfil, puede aplicarse su contenido a la escultura realizada en otros dientes o huesos pero debemos tener presente la correcta definici&#243;n de la palabra marfil indicada anteriormente y por tanto, todo material que no tenga estas caracter&#237;sticas no podr&#225; ser denominado marfil aunque en apariencia externa sea similar. &#218;nicamente la materia que re&#250;ne dichas caracter&#237;sticas es procedente de las defensas del elefante o sus predecesores. La coincidencia de otros materiales similares al marfil en aspecto general, es el tener una procedencia dental o aspecto parecido.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tanto los griegos como los hebreos y los egipcios emplearon el marfil como adorno en la decoraci&#243;n de salas, muebles y templos . Salom&#243;n ten&#237;a un trono de marfil incrustado de oro y en los museos arqueol&#243;gicos se admiran gran n&#250;mero de objetos hechos con este material pertenecientes a las m&#225;s remotas civilizaciones. El uso del marfil en las estatuas que en Grecia se produjeron prueba lo que abundaba en aquella &#233;poca. Con &#233;l, Fidias hizo las famosas estatuas gigantescas de Atenea en el Parten&#243;n y de Zeus, las cuales med&#237;an 12 y 19 metros de altura respectivamente. En estas esculturas se empleaba el marfil para representar aquellas partes del cuerpo que no cubr&#237;an los vestidos. Los romanos emplearon tambi&#233;n esta materia para la escultura y la decoraci&#243;n.</Spanish>

He brought nearly all of India (plus Afghanistan and Baluchistan) under one rule for the first (and thus far, only) time in history. Despite his great military prowess, Asoka grew weary of war; and over time he became disgusted at its stupidity and pointlessness. [PARAGRAPH:1]A popular young general and statesman, Asoka ascended to the Mauryan throne upon his father's death in 273 BC, at the approximate age of 26. He began his rule as a conqueror, seeking to expand his nation's power across the Indian subcontinent and beyond. He was quite successful, and his empire grew. [PARAGRAPH:1]However, after his bloody conquest of the Kalinga state in which over 100,000 people died and another 150,000 were injured, Asoka underwent a great spiritual change. Deeply remorseful for all of the suffering he had caused, he abandoned wars of conquest and accepted Buddhism. He turned from expansion and instead concentrated upon improving the spiritual and physical well-being of his people. He modified many of his country's harsh laws, and he advocated tolerance of all faiths. He built many Buddhist monasteries throughout the land, and the arts flourished under his rule. He sent Buddhist missionaries across the known world, including to faraway places like Greece and Egypt. Despite his fervent belief in Buddhism, Asoka demanded religious tolerance in his kingdom, saying, "Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Asoka desires that all religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart."[PARAGRAPH:1]Asoka died in 232 BC, and the empire he built lasted only fifty years after his death. His name would be virtually lost to history now, if it weren't for the discovery of a large number of columns and boulders inscribed with his words and teachings. These "Edicts of Asoka" contain not only a fount of information about King Asoka, showing him as a wise and thoughtful ruler, but they also provide invaluable knowledge of the early teachings and beliefs of Buddhism.</English>

Rong&#233; par le remord d'&#234;tre &#224; l'origine de toutes ces souffrances, il abandonne les guerres de conqu&#234;te et autorise le bouddhisme. Il se d&#233;sint&#233;resse des campagnes d'expansion et se concentre alors sur l'am&#233;lioration de la vie spirituelle et des conditions physiques de son peuple. Il modifie un grand nombre des lois s&#233;v&#232;res de son pays et pr&#244;ne la tol&#233;rance envers toutes les religions. Il construit de nombreux monast&#232;res bouddhistes sur tout le territoire, tandis que les arts prosp&#232;rent. Il envoie par ailleurs des missionnaires bouddhistes dans tout le monde connu, y compris dans des contr&#233;es aussi lointaines que l'Egypte ou la Gr&#232;ce. Malgr&#233; une fervente croyance dans le bouddhisme, Ashoka exige la tol&#233;rance religieuse dans son royaume, en affirmant que "Bien-aim&#233; des Dieux, le Roi Ashoka souhaite que toutes les religions soient partout tol&#233;r&#233;es car toutes recherchent la ma&#238;trise de soi et la puret&#233; du coeur".

Er hatte weite Teile Indiens (sowie Afghanistan und Belutschistan) zum ersten (und bisher einzigen Mal) vereint. Trotz seiner milit&#228;rischen F&#228;higkeiten hasste Ashoka den Krieg und das sinnlose Sterben von Menschen. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nach dem Tod seines Vaters im Jahr 273 vor Christus bestieg Ashoka den Thron und begann sofort mit der Vergr&#246;&#223;erung seines Einflussbereichs auf den indischen Subkontinent und dar&#252;ber hinaus. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nach einem Massaker in Kalinga, dem &#252;ber 100.000 Menschen zu Opfer fielen, durchlebte Ashoka eine tiefgreifende spirituelle Wandlung. Er entsagte dem Krieg als Mittel der Eroberung und konvertierte zum Buddhismus. Anstatt auf die weitere Ausdehnung seiner Macht konzentrierte er sich fortan auf das Wohl seines Volkes. Er reformierte die Gesetzgebung und f&#246;rderte die religi&#246;se Toleranz. Sp&#228;ter lie&#223; er unz&#228;hlige buddhistische Kl&#246;ster errichten und wurde zu einem F&#246;rderer der K&#252;nste. Er entsandte buddhistische Missionare bis nach Griechenland und &#196;gypten. Trotz seines tief verwurzelten buddhistischen Glaubens forderte Ashoka eine religi&#246;se Toleranz und verk&#252;ndete: "K&#246;nig Ashoka, der von den G&#246;ttern Geliebte, verlangt, dass sich alle Religionen &#252;berall niederlassen d&#252;rfen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Nur 50 Jahre nach Ashokas Tod im Jahr 232 vor Christus zerfiel sein Reich. Sein Name w&#228;re wohl kaum &#252;berliefert worden, wenn man nicht auf S&#228;ulen und Felsbl&#246;cke seine Lehren entdeckt h&#228;tte. Diese "Edikte des Ashoka" stellen den K&#246;nig als weisen und nachdenklichen Herrscher dar und enthalten bedeutende Hinweise auf die fr&#252;hen Lehren des Buddhismus.</German>

C.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Storia:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Asoka fu uno dei pi&#249; grandi governatori dell'India antica. Egli fu il primo (e, per il momento, l'unico) a riunire sotto il suo comando quasi tutta l'India, pi&#249; l'Afganistan e il Baluchistan. Nonostante i suoi successi militari, Asoka si stanc&#242; della guerra e, col tempo, fu disgustato dalla stupidit&#224; e dell'inutilit&#224; che essa comportava.[PARAGRAPH:1]Generale e statista giovane e popolare, Asoka sal&#236; al trono dei Mauryan alla morte del padre, nel 273 a. C., a circa 26 anni. Inizi&#242; il proprio governo come conquistatore, dedicandosi all'espansione del potere nazionale su tutto il subcontinente indiano e oltre. In questo, ebbe un discreto successo e la nazione crebbe velocemente.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuttavia, dopo la sanguinaria conquista dello stato di Ralinga, nel quale morirono 100.000 persone e altre 150.000 restarono ferite, Asoka ebbe un radicale cambiamento spirituale: profondamente pentito di tutta la sofferenza che aveva causato, abbandon&#242; le guerre di conquista e abbracci&#242; il buddismo. Una volta abbandonata l'espansione, si concentr&#242; sul miglioramento fisico e spirituale della popolazione: modific&#242; molte delle severe leggi del paese e difese la tolleranza verso tutte le fedi religiose. Costru&#236; diversi monasteri buddisti per tutto il paese e le arti fiorirono sotto il suo patrocinato. Invi&#242; missionari buddisti in tutto il mondo conosciuto, inclusi paesi lontani come Grecia ed Egitto. Nonostante la sua fede convinta nel Buddismo, Asoka richiese la tolleranza religiosa nel suo regno, alle parole di "diletti degli dei, re Asoka desidera che tutte le religioni abbiano accesso a qualsiasi luogo, poich&#233; tutte le fedi portano all'autocontrollo e alla purezza di spirito".[PARAGRAPH:1]Asoka mor&#236; nel 232 a. C. e il suo impero dur&#242; soltanto per altri cinquant'anni. Il suo nome sarebbe andato perso nella storia, se non si fossero scoperte numerose colonne e massi scolpiti con le sue parole e i suoi insegnamenti. Questi "Editti di Asoka" contengono non solo riferimenti a re Asoka, dimostrando come sia stato un sovrano saggio e benevolo, ma anche importanti informazioni sugli insegnamenti e le credenze iniziali del Buddismo.</Italian>

		<English>[H1]Ramesses II [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Pharaoh of Egypt [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 1302-1213 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Also known as "Ramesses the Great," Ramesses was an Egyptian pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty. He was the third king in his dynasty, the son of King Seti I and Queen Tuya. Ramesses was born around 1302 BC and ruled from approximately 1279 to 1213 BC. Among Ramesses' many wives, the most famous was Nefertari, who was his principal wife for over twenty years and was later deified and worshipped as a goddess. Ramesses seems to have enjoyed all of the benefits of his position as pharaoh, and he fathered about 100 children during his long rule. One of them, the Pharaoh Merneptah, became his successor. [PARAGRAPH:2]Ramesses was most famous for leading several military campaigns along the eastern Mediterranean coast. On one of these expeditions into modern-day Israel and Lebanon, Ramesses ran into the Hittite army of King Muwatallis. At the Battle of Kadesh in 1274, the two sides fought for control of the territory comprising modern Syria. It was probably the largest chariot battle ever fought, with some 5000 chariots engaged on both sides. The battle was largely inconclusive, and both sides claimed victory. However Ramesses lost more men than Muwatallis, so the Hittites probably got the best of the Egyptians. Two sides continued to struggle against one another for decades to come until they signed a peace treaty in 1258 BC-this is the first peace treaty ever recorded in history. At the other end of his domains, Ramesses also campaigned extensively south of the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia, winning additional land for Egypt. [PARAGRAPH:2]Today Ramesses is one of the best-known Egyptian pharaohs, primarily because he had so many monuments and statues of himself erected. The renowned archaeological complex of Abu Simbel-one of the best-preserved sites from ancient Egypt-was built on his orders. Ramesses' mummy was discovered in 1881; it was moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where it is still proudly displayed to the public today. (His 3000-year old body is in surprisingly good shape.) [PARAGRAPH:2]Ramesses is often popularly identified as the pharaoh who confronted Moses in the Bible. However, Ramesses lived to the age of 90 after a long reign of 66 years; he did not drown in the Red Sea; and there is no mention in the records of a slave revolt during his reign-so this seems quite unlikely.

Parmi les nombreuses femmes de Rams&#232;s, la plus c&#233;l&#232;bre est N&#233;fertari, qui est sa principale &#233;pouse pendant plus de vingt ans et qui est ensuite d&#233;ifi&#233;e et v&#233;n&#233;r&#233;e comme une d&#233;esse. Rams&#232;s semble avoir profit&#233; de tous les avantages de sa position de pharaon et engendre pr&#232;s de 100 enfants pendant son long r&#232;gne. L'un deux, le pharaon M&#233;renptah, devient son successeur. [PARAGRAPH:2]Rams&#232;s est essentiellement c&#233;l&#232;bre pour avoir dirig&#233; plusieurs campagnes militaires sur la c&#244;te m&#233;diterran&#233;enne orientale. Au cours de l'une de ces exp&#233;ditions dans la r&#233;gion qui correspond aujourd'hui &#224; Isra&#235;l et au Liban, il affronte l'arm&#233;e hittite du roi Mouwatalli. Lors de la bataille de Qadesh en 1274 av. J.-C., les deux camps luttent pour le contr&#244;le d'un territoire correspondant &#224; l'actuelle Syrie. Il s'agit sans doute de la plus importante bataille de chars de l'histoire, pr&#232;s de 5000 &#233;tant engag&#233;s de chaque c&#244;t&#233;. L'issue du combat n'est pas claire et chaque camp clame victoire. Cependant, Rams&#232;s a perdu davantage d'hommes que Mouwatalli et les Hittites ont sans doute &#233;t&#233; meilleurs que les Egyptiens. Les deux camps continuent &#224; se battre pendant des d&#233;cennies avant de parvenir &#224; signer, en 1258 av. J.-C., le premier trait&#233; de paix de l'histoire. A l'autre extr&#233;mit&#233; de ses territoires, Rams&#232;s engage &#233;galement d'importantes campagnes au sud de la premi&#232;re cataracte du Nil, en Nubie, o&#249; il offre &#224; l'Egypte de nouvelles terres. [PARAGRAPH:2]Aujourd'hui, Rams&#232;s est l'un des pharaons les plus connus, essentiellement car il a &#233;rig&#233; beaucoup de monuments et de statues de lui.

[PARAGRAPH:2]Rams&#232;s est souvent identifi&#233; comme le pharaon s'&#233;tant trouv&#233; face &#224; Mo&#239;se dans la Bible. Cependant, Rams&#232;s a v&#233;cu jusqu'&#224; l'&#226;ge de 90 ans, apr&#232;s un long r&#232;gne de 66 ans, il ne s'est pas noy&#233; dans la mer Rouge et il n'est fait mention d'aucune r&#233;volte d'esclaves pendant son r&#232;gne.

Dynastie. Ramses II. wurde um 1302 vor Christus geboren und regierte etwa von 1279 bis 1213 vor Christus. Die wahrscheinlich ber&#252;hmteste seiner vielen Ehefrauen war Nefertari, die &#252;ber zwanzig Jahre als seine Hauptgemahlin galt und sp&#228;ter zur G&#246;ttin erhoben wurde. Ramses scheint alle Vorz&#252;ge seiner Position als Pharao in vollen Z&#252;gen genossen zu haben und soll w&#228;hrend seiner langen Regentschaft etwa 100 Kinder gezeugt haben. Eins davon, Pharao Merenptah, trat nach seinem Tod seine Nachfolge an. [PARAGRAPH:2]Ramses f&#252;hrte einige Feldz&#252;ge entlang der &#246;stlichen Mittelmeerk&#252;ste durch. Einer davon brachte ihn ins heutige Israel und in den Libanon, wo er auf das Hethiter-Heer von K&#246;nig Muwatalli traf. In der Schlacht bei Kadesch im Jahr 1274 vor Christus, dem mit etwa 5.000 beteiligten Streitwagen auf beiden Seiten vermutlich gr&#246;&#223;ten Streitwagengefecht aller Zeiten, k&#228;mpften beide Parteien um die Vorherrschaft &#252;ber das Gebiet des heutigen Syrien. Im Grunde genommen ging der Kampf unentschieden aus, so dass beide Seiten den Sieg f&#252;r sich beanspruchten. Ramses hatte jedoch mehr M&#228;nner verloren als Muwatalli und so waren die Hethiter wohl besser davongekommen als die &#196;gypter. Beide Seiten stritten und k&#228;mpften noch jahrzehntelang, bis sie schlie&#223;lich im Jahr 1258 vor Christus einen Friedensvertrag schlossen-im &#220;brigen den ersten geschichtlich dokumentierten Friedensvertrag &#252;berhaupt. Am anderen Ende seines Hoheitsgebiets k&#228;mpfte sich Ramses ebenfalls weit nach S&#252;den hinter den Ersten Katarakts des Nils in Nubien durch und eroberte hier neues Territorium f&#252;r &#196;gypten. [PARAGRAPH:2]Heute z&#228;hlt Ramses zu einem der bekanntesten &#228;gyptischen Pharaonen, vor allem, weil er so viele Monumente und Statuen errichten lie&#223;. Er war es auch, der den Bau der Tempelanlage Abu Simbel-eine der am besten erhaltenen arch&#228;ologischen Ausgrabungsst&#228;tten aus dem alten &#196;gypten-in Auftrag gab. Ramses' Mumie wurde im Jahr 1881 entdeckt und in das &#196;gyptische Museum in Kairo gebracht, wo sie noch heute von der &#214;ffentlichkeit bestaunt werden kann. (Sein 3000 Jahre alter K&#246;rper ist &#252;berraschend gut erhalten.) [PARAGRAPH:2]Ramses wird h&#228;ufig als der Pharao identifiziert, der laut Bibel in eine Konfrontation mit Moses geriet. Allerdings wurde Ramses nach einer langen Regierungszeit von 66 Jahren 90 Jahre alt, er ertrank nicht im Roten Meer und es gibt in den geschichtlichen Aufzeichnungen auch keinerlei Hinweis auf einen Sklavenaufstand w&#228;hrend seiner Regentschaft-damit ist das also ziemlich unwahrscheinlich.

Ramses nacque intorno al 1302 a.C. e regn&#242; dal 1279 circa al 1213. Tra le sue numerose mogli, la pi&#249; famosa fu Nefertari, sua prima moglie per oltre vent'anni e in seguito deificata e venerata come una dea. Ramses a quanto pare godette appieno di tutti i vantaggi connessi con la sua posizione di faraone, visto che pare che nel suo lungo regno ebbe oltre 100 figli. Uno di loro, Merneptah, gli succedette al trono. [PARAGRAPH:2]Ramses &#232; famoso soprattutto per le sue campagne militari lungo la costa orientale del Mediterraneo. In una di queste spedizioni in quelli che oggi sono Israele e Libano, Ramses si scontr&#242; con gli Ittiti di re Muwatali. Nel 1274 i due eserciti si scontrarono a Qadesh per il controllo dell'odierna Siria. Probabilmente fu la pi&#249; grande battaglia con bighe mai combattuta, visto che ve n'erano oltre 5.000 per entrambe le fazioni. La battaglia non ebbe un esito netto, tanto che entrambi reclamarono la vittoria. Ramses tuttavia perse pi&#249; uomini di Muwatali, quindi furono probabilmente gli Ittiti ad avere la meglio. I due popoli continuarono a scontrarsi per un decennio finch&#233; non siglarono un trattato di pace nel 1258 a.C., il primo di cui si ha notizia nella storia. All'altro capo dei suoi domini, Ramses condusse altre campagne, spingendosi a sud della prima cataratta del Nilo fino in Nubia, espandendo il territorio egizio. [PARAGRAPH:2]Oggi Ramses &#232; uno dei faraoni pi&#249; noti soprattutto grazie ai numerosi monumenti e statue che fece erigere per s&#233;. Il rinomato complesso archeologico di Abu Simbel, uno dei siti archeologici dell'antico Egitto meglio preservati, fu costruito per ordine suo. La mummia di Ramses fu scoperta nel 1881 e fu trasportata al Museo egiziano del Cairo, dove &#232; ancora oggi messa orgogliosamente in mostra (porta molto bene i suoi 3.000 anni!). [PARAGRAPH:2]Ramses viene spesso comunemente identificato con il faraone che Mos&#232; sfid&#242; nella Bibbia. Ramses tuttavia giunse ai 90 anni dopo aver regnato per 66 anni, non anneg&#242; nel Mar Rosso e non vi sono notizie di rivolte di schiavi nei suoi registri, quindi la cosa sembra alquanto improbabile.

		<English>[H1]Augustus Caesar [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Roman Emperor [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] 63 BC-14 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Born Gaius Octavius, Augustus would become the first (and possibly greatest) Roman Emperor. He ended a century of civil wars and initiated two hundred years of the Pax Romana (Roman Peace) while overseeing a golden age of Roman literature and culture. Octavius was born in 63 BC. His father (also named Gaius Octavius) was a respectable but undistinguished member of the equestrian order. His mother, however, was a niece of Julius Caesar. Octavius' father died when he was only four years old, and he was brought up in the house of his stepfather Lucius Marcus Phillippus. [PARAGRAPH:2]At the age of fifteen, Octavius put on the toga virilis ("manly robes"), the symbol that he had reached adulthood and was elected to the College of Pontiffs. In 46 BC he joined Julius Caesar during Caesar's last campaign in Spain. In Spain he made such a fine impression on the great general that Julius Caesar changed his will to make Octavius his heir. When Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March in 44 BC, all the wealth that Caesar had spent a lifetime accumulating passed into the hands of the 18-year old Octavius. He would use them well. [PARAGRAPH:2]At the time of Caesar's assassination, Octavius was with some of his soldiers in modern-day Albania. Upon hearing the news he went to Italy and recruited an army from among Caesar's veterans, gaining their loyalty by stressing that he was Caesar's heir. Once in Rome, Octavius allied with Marc Antony and Marcus Lepidus to form what is known as the "Second Triumvirate," directed against Caesar's killers Marcus Brutus and Gaius Cassius. Octavius' and Antony's armies tracked down Brutus and Cassius in Greece, where they defeated the assassins' army at Philippi (42 BC). Brutus and Cassius both committed suicide after their defeat. [PARAGRAPH:2]Antony married Octavius' sister Octavia to cement their alliance, and the two leaders divided Rome's territory between them. Octavius took the west, while Antony went to the east, where he entered into a torrid affair with Cleopatra, the ruler of Egypt. Octavius saw Antony's actions as an insult to his sister and to his family, and relations between the co-rulers soon soured. While Antony enjoyed the pleasures of Egypt, back in Rome Octavius strengthened his political position and his armies. The two eventually went to war, and in 31 BC Octavius defeated the forces of Antony and Cleopatra at the naval battle of Actium. The lovers were pursued to Egypt, where they both committed suicide. [PARAGRAPH:2]Octavius was now the undisputed master of Rome. He surrendered his extraordinary powers to the Senate, which was filled with his allies; in return the Senate named , him "Augustus" (one who is marked by dignity and greatness) and showered him with honors. More importantly, they also gave him the powers of a Roman consul, tribune, and censor, which had never before been combined into one office. All permanent legal power within Rome officially remained within the Senate-but since Octavius controlled the senate, this was mostly a legal fiction. Although he had all of the power of an Emperor, Augustus preferred to style himself "Princeps," or "first citizen" (probably to avoid further antagonizing the remaining republicans in Rome). [PARAGRAPH:2]During his reign Augustus presided over four decades of peace and prosperity, a welcome relief to Rome after almost a century of civil strife. He carried out a great building program in the ancient city, constructing a new Senate house as well as great temples to Apollo and "Divine Julius" (his deceased great-uncle). Later, Augustus would boast-with justification-that he had found Rome a city of brick and left it marble. Under his patronage many of the most famous Roman authors and poets created their great works: Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and Livy all flourished during his reign. [PARAGRAPH:2]Augustus' generals also enjoyed great success and were quite relieved to be once again turning their military strength against external enemies instead of one another. Rome's borders were extended to the Danube; northern Spain was finally conquered; and Armenia was pacified in the east. By Augustus' death in 14 AD, a return to the old system of the Republic was unthinkable. He was peacefully succeeded by the Emperor Tiberius, and for more than two centuries the Roman Empire would dominate the Mediterranean without any major wars-due in large part to the wise statesmanship of Augustus.

		<French>[H1]Auguste C&#233;sar[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Empereur romain[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Dates : [\BOLD] 63 av. J.-C.-14[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Biographie :[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]N&#233; sous le nom de Caius Octavius, Auguste deviendra le premier et sans doute le plus grand empereur romain. Il met fin &#224; un si&#232;cle de guerres civiles et initie deux cents ans de Pax Romana, c'est-&#224;-dire de paix romaine, tout en supervisant un &#226;ge d'or de la litt&#233;rature et de la culture romaine. Octave est n&#233; en 63 av. J.-C. Son p&#232;re, &#233;galement nomm&#233; Caius Octavius, est un membre respectable mais insignifiant de l'ordre &#233;questre, alors que sa m&#232;re est une ni&#232;ce de Jules C&#233;sar. Le p&#232;re d'Octave meurt alors que son fils n'a que quatre ans. Ce dernier est alors &#233;lev&#233; dans la maison de son beau-p&#232;re Lucius Marcius Philippus. [PARAGRAPH:2]A quinze ans, Octave rev&#234;t la toge virile, symbole du passage &#224; l'&#226;ge adulte et est &#233;lu au coll&#232;ge des pontifes. En 46 av. J.-C., il rejoint Jules C&#233;sar lors de sa derni&#232;re campagne en Espagne. Il y fait alors tellement bonne impression que le grand g&#233;n&#233;ral Jules C&#233;sar modifie son testament pour faire d'Octave son h&#233;ritier. Lorsque C&#233;sar est assassin&#233; aux ides de mars en 44 av. J.-C., toutes les richesses accumul&#233;es par C&#233;sar au cours de sa vie sont transmises &#224; Octave, qui est alors &#226;g&#233; de 18 ans et qui en fera bon usage. [PARAGRAPH:2]Lors de l'assassinat de C&#233;sar, Octave se trouve avec quelques-uns de ses soldats dans l'actuelle Albanie. En apprenant la nouvelle, il se rend en Italie et recrute une arm&#233;e compos&#233;e de v&#233;t&#233;rans de C&#233;sar, acqu&#233;rant leur loyaut&#233; en soulignant qu'il est l'h&#233;ritier de C&#233;sar. Une fois &#224; Rome, Octave s'allie avec Marc Antoine et L&#233;pide pour former ce qui est appel&#233; le "second triumvirat" et qui s'oppose aux assassins de C&#233;sar, Marcus Brutus et Caius Cassius. Les arm&#233;es d'Octave et de Marc Antoine retrouvent Brutus et Cassius en Gr&#232;ce, o&#249; ils d&#233;font l'arm&#233;e des assassins &#224; la bataille des Philippes (42 av. J.-C.). Brutus et Cassius se suicident apr&#232;s leur d&#233;faite. [PARAGRAPH:2]Marc Antoine se marie avec la soeur d'Octave, Octavie pour sceller leur alliance et les deux leaders se partagent le territoire romain. Octave prend la partie occidentale, tandis que Marc Antoine obtient celle de l'Est, o&#249; il entame une liaison avec Cl&#233;op&#226;tre, qui r&#232;gne sur l'Egypte. Octave voit dans l'attitude de Marc Antoine une insulte &#224; sa soeur et &#224; sa famille, et les relations entre les deux co-dirigeants se d&#233;gradent rapidement. Alors que Marc Antoine go&#251;te aux plaisirs d'Egypte, de retour &#224; Rome, Octave renforce sa fonction politique et ses arm&#233;es. Les deux hommes finissent par entrer en guerre et, en 31 av. J.-C., Octave bat les forces de Marc Antoine et de Cl&#233;op&#226;tre lors de la bataille navale d'Actium. Les amants sont poursuivis en Egypte, o&#249; ils se suicident. [PARAGRAPH:2]Octave est d&#233;sormais le ma&#238;tre incontest&#233; de Rome. Il c&#232;de ses pouvoirs extraordinaires au S&#233;nat, qui n'est compos&#233; que de ses alli&#233;s, et en &#233;change, le S&#233;nat le surnomme "Augustus" (celui qui est empreint de dignit&#233; et de grandeur) et le couvre d'honneurs. Plus important encore, il lui donne les pouvoirs d'un consul romain, d'un tribun et d'un censeur, qui n'avaient jusqu'alors jamais &#233;t&#233; combin&#233;s dans une m&#234;me fonction. Tout le pouvoir juridique classique dans Rome reste officiellement de la comp&#233;tence du S&#233;nat, mais il s'agit essentiellement d'une illusion car Octave le contr&#244;le enti&#232;rement. Bien qu'il ait tous les pouvoirs d'un empereur, Auguste pr&#233;f&#232;re se donner le titre de princeps, c'est-&#224;-dire de premier citoyen, sans doute pour &#233;viter de contrarier les r&#233;publicains de Rome. [PARAGRAPH:2]Le r&#232;gne d'Auguste est marqu&#233; par plus de quatre d&#233;cennies de paix et de prosp&#233;rit&#233;, au grand soulagement de Rome apr&#232;s presque un si&#232;cle de guerre civile. Il r&#233;alise un grand programme de construction dans l'ancienne ville, construisant un nouveau s&#233;nat et de magnifiques temples d&#233;di&#233;s &#224; Apollon et au "divin Julius" (son d&#233;funt grand-oncle). Auguste se vante ensuite, &#224; juste titre, d'avoir trouv&#233; Rome en brique et de l'avoir laiss&#233;e en marbre. Sous son patronage, bon nombre des plus c&#233;l&#232;bres auteurs et po&#232;tes romains composent leurs plus grandes oeuvres : Virgile, Ovide, Horace et Livy prosp&#232;rent sous son r&#232;gne. [PARAGRAPH:2]Les g&#233;n&#233;raux d'Auguste connaissent &#233;galement d'importants succ&#232;s et sont presque soulag&#233;s de faire une nouvelle fois preuve de leur puissance militaire contre des ennemis externes plut&#244;t que contre l'un des leurs. Les fronti&#232;res de l'Empire romain sont &#233;tendues jusqu'au Danube, le nord de l'Espagne est finalement conquis et &#224; l'Est, l'Arm&#233;nie est pacifi&#233;e. A la mort d'Auguste en 14 ap. J.-C., un retour &#224; l'ancien syst&#232;me de la R&#233;publique est impensable. L'empereur Tiberius lui succ&#232;de de mani&#232;re pacifique et, pendant plus de deux si&#232;cles, l'Empire romain va dominer la M&#233;diterran&#233;e, sans guerre majeure, ce qui s'explique en grande partie par les sages qualit&#233;s d'homme d'Etat d'Auguste.

		<German>[H1]Augustus C&#228;sar [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]R&#246;mischer Staatsmann[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lebte: [\BOLD] 63 vor Christus-14[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Hintergrund:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Als Gaius Octavius geboren, sollte Augustus der erste (und m&#246;glicherweise gr&#246;&#223;te) r&#246;mische Kaiser werden. Er beendete ein Jahrhundert der B&#252;rgerkriege und begr&#252;ndete die 200 Jahre w&#228;hrende Pax Romana (R&#246;mischer Friede), die zugleich ein goldenes Zeitalter der r&#246;mischen Literatur und Kultur einl&#228;utete. Octavius wurde 63 vor Christus geboren. Sein Vater (der ebenfalls Gaius Octavius hie&#223;) war ein geachteter, aber dennoch unbedeutender Angeh&#246;riger der Equites (r&#246;mischer Ritterstand). Seine Mutter war eine Nichte Julius C&#228;sars. Als Octavius' Vater starb, war er selbst erst vier Jahre alt und so wuchs er im Haus seines Stiefvaters Lucius Marcus Phillippus auf. [PARAGRAPH:2]Im Alter von 15 Jahren streifte er die "Toga Virilis" (M&#228;nner-Toga) &#252;ber-das Symbol daf&#252;r, dass er jetzt ein erwachsener B&#252;rger war-und wurde in das Priesterkollegium gew&#228;hlt. Im Jahr 46 vor Christus begleitete er Julius C&#228;sar auf dessen letzten Feldzug in Spanien. Dort angekommen, beeindruckte er den gro&#223;en Feldherrn derma&#223;en, dass Julius C&#228;sar sein Testament &#228;nderte und Octavius zu seinem Haupterben bestimmte. Nach C&#228;sars Ermordung in den Iden des M&#228;rz im Jahr 44 vor Christus ging das gesamte Verm&#246;gen, das C&#228;sar im Laufe seines Lebens angeh&#228;uft hatte, in den Besitz des 18-j&#228;hrigen Octavius &#252;ber. Und er sollte es sinnvoll nutzen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Zum Zeitpunkt von C&#228;sars Ermordung hielt sich Octavius mit einigen seiner Soldaten im heutigen Albanien auf. Als ihn die Todesnachricht erreichte, kehrte er nach Italien zur&#252;ck und rekrutierte eine aus C&#228;sars Veteranen bestehende Armee, deren Loyalit&#228;t er sich sicherte, indem er betonte, dass er C&#228;sars Erbe war. In Rom angekommen, verb&#252;ndete sich Octavius mit Marcus Antonius und Marcus Lepidus zum so genannten "Zweiten Triumvirat", das sich gegen C&#228;sars M&#246;rder Marcus Brutus und Gaius Cassius richtete. Die Streitkr&#228;fte von Octavius und Antonius sp&#252;rten Brutus und Cassius in Griechenland auf und schlugen die Truppen der C&#228;sarenm&#246;rder bei Philippi (42 vor Christus). Sowohl Brutus als auch Cassius begingen nach ihrer Niederlage Selbstmord. [PARAGRAPH:2]Zur Bekr&#228;ftigung ihres B&#252;ndnisses heiratete Antonius Octavius' Schwester Octavia und die beiden Feldherren teilten das r&#246;mische Territorium untereinander auf: Octavius behielt den westlichen Teil, w&#228;hrend Antonius nach Osten ging, wo er eine sagenumwobene Aff&#228;re mit der &#228;gyptischen K&#246;nigin Kleopatra begann. Octavius betrachtete Antonius' Verhalten als Beleidigung seiner Schwester und seiner Familie und so k&#252;hlte sich das Verh&#228;ltnis der beiden Co-Regenten merklich ab. W&#228;hrend Antonius in &#196;gypten die Freuden des Lebens genoss, festigte Octavius derweil in Rom seinen politischen Einfluss und verst&#228;rkte seine Truppen. Schlie&#223;lich zogen die beiden gegeneinander in den Krieg und im Jahr 31 vor Christus besiegte Octavius die Truppen von Antonius und Kleopatra in der Seeschlacht bei Actium. Das Liebespaar wurde bis nach &#196;gypten verfolgt, wo sie am Ende beide Selbstmord begingen. [PARAGRAPH:2]Octavius war nun der unangefochtene Alleinherrscher Roms. Er &#252;bertrug seine enorme Macht an den Senat, in dem zahlreiche seiner Verb&#252;ndeten sa&#223;en. Im Gegenzug verlieh ihm der Senat den Ehrennamen "Augustus" (der Erhabene) und &#252;bersch&#252;ttete ihn mit Ehrungen. Wichtiger als das war jedoch, dass der Senat ihm auch die Titel des r&#246;mischen Konsuls, Tribuns und Zensors zuerkannte, die nie zuvor auf eine einzige Person vereint worden waren. Die juristische Macht innerhalb Roms oblag offiziell dem Senat-aber da Octavius den Senat kontrollierte, war das alles lediglich b&#252;rokratische Augenwischerei. Obwohl er die ganze Macht eines Kaisers innehatte, bevorzugte Augustus seine Selbstdarstellung als "Princeps" oder "Erster B&#252;rger" (vielleicht, um die verbleibenden Republikaner in Rom nicht noch mehr gegen sich aufzubringen). [PARAGRAPH:2]W&#228;hrend seiner Regentschaft herrschte vier Jahrzehnte lang Frieden und Wohlstand-nach fast einem Jahrhundert der B&#252;rgerkriege und Unruhen eine willkommene Verschnaufpause f&#252;r die R&#246;mer. Augustus f&#252;hrte ein beeindruckendes Bauprogramm in der antiken Stadt durch und errichtete unter anderem ein neues Senatsgeb&#228;ude sowie gro&#223;artige Tempel wie den Apollo-Tempel und den "Tempel des Divus Iulius" (zu Ehren seines verstorbenen Gro&#223;onkels). Sp&#228;ter br&#252;stete sich Augustus-zu Recht-damit, dass er Rom von einer Stadt aus Ziegeln in eine Stadt aus Marmor verwandelt habe. W&#228;hrend seiner Amtszeit entstanden die gr&#246;&#223;ten Werke der ber&#252;hmtesten r&#246;mischen Schriftsteller und Dichter: Virgil, Ovid, Horaz und Livius liefen allesamt zur Hochform auf. [PARAGRAPH:2]Augustus' Gener&#228;le feierten gro&#223;e Erfolge und waren froh dar&#252;ber, ihre milit&#228;rische Schlagkraft nach langer Zeit endlich wieder gegen ausl&#228;ndische Feinde einsetzen zu k&#246;nnen, statt gegen die eigenen Landsleute. Die Grenzen Roms wurden bis an die Donau ausgeweitet, Nordspanien wurde erobert und Armenien im Osten befriedet. Nach Augustus' Tod im Jahr 14 nach Christus war eine R&#252;ckkehr zum alten System der Republik undenkbar und so trat Kaiser Tiberius friedlich seine Nachfolge an. Auch in den darauf folgenden 200 Jahren dominierte das R&#246;mische Reich den Mittelmeerraum ohne gr&#246;&#223;ere kriegerische Auseinandersetzungen-was gr&#246;&#223;tenteils auf die weise Staatsf&#252;hrung des Kaisers Augustus zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren war.

		<Italian>[H1]Augusto Cesare [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Imperatore Romano [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vissuto nel: [\BOLD] 63 a. C.-14[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Nato come Gaio Ottavio (Ottaviano), Augusto fu il primo (e forse il pi&#249; grande) imperatore romano. Egli pose fine a un secolo di guerre civili e diede il via a due secoli di Pax Romana ("pace romana"), mentre sotto il suo regno la letteratura e la cultura romana ebbero la loro et&#224; dell'oro. Augusto nacque nel 63 a.C. Suo padre (che faceva anch'egli Gaio Ottavio di nome) era un membro rispettabile ma non particolarmente distinto dell'ordine equestre. Sua madre, invece, era nipote di Giulio Cesare. Il padre mor&#236; quando Ottaviano aveva solo quattro anni. Egli fu perci&#242; allevato nella casa del patrigno Lucio Marco Filippo. [PARAGRAPH:2]A quindici anni, Ottaviano indoss&#242; la toga virilis ("abito d'adulto"), a testimonianza del raggiungimento della maggiore et&#224; e fu eletto nel collegio dei pontefici. Nel 46 a.C. si un&#236; a Cesare nell'ultima campagna di Spagna del condottiero. In Spagna impression&#242; talmente il grande generale da fargli cambiare il testamento e nominare lui come erede. Quando Cesare fu assassinato (Idi di marzo del 44 a.C.), tutte le ricchezze che Cesare aveva accumulato nella vita passarono al diciottenne Ottaviano. Che le avrebbe impiegate bene. [PARAGRAPH:2]Al tempo dell'assassinio di Cesare, Ottaviano si trovava nell'odierna Albania con i suoi soldati. Alla notizia dell'assassinio, si precipit&#242; in Italia e reclut&#242; un esercito formato dai veterani di Cesare, guadagnandosi la loro fiducia evidenziando il fatto che lui era suo erede. Giunto a Roma, Ottaviano si alle&#242; con Marc'Antonio e Marco Lepido per formare il cosiddetto "Secondo Triumvirato" e dare la caccia agli assassini di Cesare, Marco Bruto e Gaio Cassio. Le armate di Ottaviano e Antonio rintracciarono Bruto e Cassio in Grecia, sconfiggendoli a Filippi (42 a.C.). Entrambi gli assassini si suicidarono dopo la sconfitta. [PARAGRAPH:2]Antonio spos&#242; la sorella di Ottaviano, Ottavia, cementando cos&#236; la loro alleanza e i due si divisero l'impero. Ottaviano prese l'occidente, Antonio l'oriente, dove pi&#249; tardi fu coinvolto in una relazione con Cleopatra, sovrana d'Egitto. Ottaviano si reput&#242; offeso per il comportamento di Antonio nei confronti della sorella e i rapporti tra i due si inasprirono. Mentre Antonio si godeva i piaceri dell'Egitto, a Roma Ottaviano rafforzava la sua posizione politica e il suo esercito. I due scesero infine in guerra e nel 31 a.C. Ottaviano sconfisse le forze di Antonio e Cleopatra nella battaglia navale di Azio. I due amanti furono inseguiti fino in Egitto, dove entrambi si suicidarono. [PARAGRAPH:2]Ottaviano divenne cos&#236; il padrone indiscusso di Roma. Egli si spogli&#242; dei suoi poteri destinandoli al Senato, che era pieno di suoi alleati; in cambio il Senato lo proclam&#242; "Augusto" (uomo di grande dignit&#224; e maestosit&#224;) e lo ricopr&#236; di onori. Ma, cosa ancora pi&#249; importante, gli diedero insieme i poteri di console, tribuno e censore, cosa mai accaduta prima. Tutti i poteri legislativi rimanevano ufficialmente al Senato, ma dato che Ottaviano controllava il Senato, si trattava quasi di una finzione legale. Nonostante godesse dunque dei poteri di un imperatore, Augusto prefer&#236; considerarsi un "Principe", o "primo cittadino", probabilmente per evitare di inimicarsi ulteriormente gli ultimi repubblicani rimasti. [PARAGRAPH:2]Durante il suo regno Augusto govern&#242; per oltre quarant'anni in pace e prosperit&#224;, parecchio benvenute dopo quasi un secolo di guerre intestine. Egli inoltre avvi&#242; un grandioso programma edilizio nella citt&#224; antica, costruendo un nuovo Senato e grandiosi templi per Apollo e il "divino Giulio" (il suo prozio morto). In seguito Augusto pot&#233; affermare, a pieno titolo, di aver trovato una Roma di mattoni e di aver lasciato una Roma di marmo. Molti tra gli artisti e letterati pi&#249; famosi crearono i loro capolavori sotto il suo patrocinio: Virgilio, Ovidio, Orazio e Livio. [PARAGRAPH:2]Anche i generali di Augusto ebbero grande successo e fu per loro un sollievo poter rivolgere le forze militari al loro comando contro nemici esterni invece che l'uno contro l'altro. I confini di Roma furono estesi fino al Danubio; la Spagna del nord fu finalmente soggiogata; in oriente l'Armenia fu pacificata. Alla morte di Augusto (14 d.C.), il ritorno al sistema repubblicano era impensabile. A lui succedette pacificamente l'imperatore Tiberio e per altri duecento anni l'Impero romano avrebbe dominato nel bacino del Mediterraneo senza dover ricorrere a grandi guerre e questo in larga parte grazie al lavoro svolto in precedenza da Augusto.

		<Spanish>[H1]Augusto C&#233;sar [\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperador de Roma [\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Vivi&#243;: [\BOLD] 63 a. C.-14[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Biograf&#237;a:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Nacido Cayo Octavio, Augusto se convertir&#237;a en el primer (y quiz&#225; el m&#225;s grande) de los emperadores romanos. Acab&#243; con un siglo de guerras civiles e inaugur&#243; doscientos a&#241;os de Pax Romana, adem&#225;s de una edad de oro de la literatura y la cultura romanas. Octavio naci&#243; en el a&#241;o 63 a. C. Su padre (llamado tambi&#233;n Cayo Octavio) era un respetable pero modesto miembro de la orden ecuestre. Su madre, en cambio, era sobrina de Julio C&#233;sar. El padre de Octavio muri&#243; cuando &#233;l ten&#237;a solo cuatro a&#241;os, y el muchacho se cri&#243; en la casa de su padrastro, Lucio Marco Filipo. [PARAGRAPH:2]A la edad de quince a&#241;os, Octavio visti&#243; la toga virilis ("toga viril"), s&#237;mbolo de que hab&#237;a alcanzado la mayor&#237;a de edad, y fue elegido para el Colegio de Pont&#237;fices. En el a&#241;o 46 a. C. acompa&#241;&#243; a Julio C&#233;sar en su &#250;ltima campa&#241;a en Hispania. All&#237; caus&#243; tan honda impresi&#243;n al gran general, que &#233;ste cambi&#243; su testamento para convertirlo en su heredero. Cuando C&#233;sar fue asesinado, en los Idus de marzo del 44 a. C., todas las riquezas que hab&#237;a acumulado a lo largo de su vida pasaron a manos de Octavio, que por entonces contaba 18 a&#241;os. Les dar&#237;a muy buen uso. [PARAGRAPH:2]En el momento del asesinato de C&#233;sar, Octavio se encontraba con algunos de sus soldados en la moderna Albania. Al enterarse de la noticia, march&#243; a Italia y reclut&#243; un ej&#233;rcito entre los veteranos de C&#233;sar, cuya lealtad se asegur&#243; subrayando el hecho de que era su heredero. Una vez en Roma, Octavio se ali&#243; con Marco Antonio y Marco L&#233;pido para formar lo que se conoce como "segundo triunvirato", dirigido contra los asesinos de C&#233;sar, Marco Bruto y Cayo Casio. Los ej&#233;rcitos de Octavio y Antonio siguieron a Bruto y a Casio hasta Grecia, donde los derrotaron en la batalla de Filipos (42 a. C.). Bruto y Casio se suicidaron tras la derrota. [PARAGRAPH:2]Antonio se cas&#243; con la hermana de Octavio, Octavia, para cimentar su alianza, y los dos l&#237;deres se dividieron el territorio de Roma. Octavio se qued&#243; con el oeste, mientras que Antonio fue al este, donde inici&#243; una t&#243;rrida aventura con Cleopatra, se&#241;ora de Egipto. Octavio vio las acciones de Antonio como un insulto para su hermana y su familia, y las relaciones entre ambos gobernantes no tardaron en arruinarse. Mientras Antonio disfrutaba de los placeres de Egipto, Octavio, en Roma, reforzaba su poder pol&#237;tico y sus ej&#233;rcitos. Finalmente estall&#243; la guerra y, en el a&#241;o 31 a. C., Octavio derrot&#243; a las fuerzas de Antonio y Cleopatra en la batalla naval de Actium. Los amantes fueron perseguidos hasta Egipto, donde se suicidaron. [PARAGRAPH:2]Octavio era ahora el amo indiscutible de Roma. Entreg&#243; sus poderes extraordinarios al Senado, que estaba lleno de aliados suyos y, a cambio, el Senado lo nombr&#243; "Augusto" (hombre de dignidad y grandeza) y lo cubri&#243; de honores. Y, lo que es m&#225;s importante a&#250;n, le concedi&#243; los poderes de un c&#243;nsul y un censor, que nunca hab&#237;an estado combinados en una sola magistratura. Todo el poder permanente qued&#243; en manos del Senado, pero como Octavio controlaba el Senado, esto era m&#225;s que nada una ficci&#243;n legal. Aunque ten&#237;a el poder de un aut&#233;ntico emperador, Augusto prefer&#237;a hacerse llamar "princeps" o "primer ciudadano" (posiblemente para no soliviantar m&#225;s a los republicanos que a&#250;n quedaban en Roma). [PARAGRAPH:2]Durante el reinado de Augusto, Roma vivi&#243; cuatro d&#233;cadas de paz y prosperidad, un agradable cambio despu&#233;s de casi un siglo de conflictos civiles. Llev&#243; a cabo un gran programa de construcciones en la vieja ciudad, en el que se incluy&#243; una nueva sede para el Senado y grandes templos para Apolo y el "Divino Julio" (su fallecido t&#237;o-abuelo). M&#225;s tarde, a Augusto le gustar&#237;a presumir de que hab&#237;a encontrado una Roma hecha de ladrillo y hab&#237;a dejado una de m&#225;rmol. Bajo su protecci&#243;n, muchos de los m&#225;s famosos autores y poetas de Roma crearon sus grandes obras: Virgilio, Ovidio, Horacio y Livio vivieron sus momentos de mayor gloria durante su reinado. [PARAGRAPH:2]Los generales de Augusto disfrutaron tambi&#233;n de gran &#233;xito y, para alivio de todos, pudieron dirigir de nuevo sus fuerzas contra enemigos externos, en lugar de enfrentarse unos a otros. Las fronteras de Roma se extendieron hasta el Danubio, se culmin&#243; la conquista del norte de Hispania y, en el este, Armenia fue pacificada. A la muerte de Augusto, en el 14 a. C., un retorno al viejo sistema republicano era inimaginable. La sucesi&#243;n recay&#243; en Tiberio sin derramamiento de sangre, y durante los dos siglos siguientes, el Imperio Romano dominar&#237;a el Mediterr&#225;neo sin guerras importantes, debido en parte al sabio gobierno de Augusto.</Spanish>
