MAC User cannot play with more than 18 CIVs.

If MAC users play multiplayer with windows users, 
the windows players have to delete the CvGameCoreDLL.dll (for 52 CIVs) in the PAE/Assets folder first.
Otherwise the game can't start due to 18 CIVs <-> 52 CIVs (MAC <-> Windows).

You can find a copy of the CvGameCoreDLL.dll (for 52 CIVs) in the PAE_Extras/52Civs folder.
